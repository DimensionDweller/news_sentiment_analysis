                "content": "\n      Lawyers for former President Donald Trump asked a judge to delay the start of a sexual assault and defamation trial for one month to allow a “cooling off” period following the historic indictment charging Trump with falsifying business records.\n  \n\n      Joe Tacopina, an attorney for Trump, asked the judge overseeing the battery and defamation lawsuit brought by former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll to delay the trial until the end of May. The trial is scheduled to start on April 25.\n  \n\n      Tacopina said the pool of potential jurors will have the criminal charges “top of mind” when they are called due to intense media coverage and that could taint the jury pool. Trump was charged with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about a past affair days before the 2016 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n  \n\n      “To be sure, President Trump is a persistent subject of media coverage. But the present situation is unique because, as stated above, the recent coverage pertains to alleged sexual misconduct, the same issue at the heart of this litigation,” Tacopina said in his letter to Judge Lewis Kaplan. \n  \n\n      Carroll is opposed to the delay request, according to a letter from her attorney, Roberta Kaplan, who called the request “meritless” and said that “there is every reason to believe that the Court can empanel a fair jury in this case” given the size and diverse population of New York City and its nearby counties.\n  \n\n      “Waiting an additional four weeks will do nothing to ‘cool’ the unavoidable press and security concerns that will attend this trial—concerns that Your Honor has taken substantial measures to address,” the letter stated. “And in all events, Trump is exceptionally ill-suited to complain about fairness when he has instigated (and sought to benefit from) so much of the very coverage about which he now complains.”\n  \n\n      Kaplan’s letter continued, “The fact that Trump is the subject of an unusually large number of criminal investigations cannot possibly mean that Carroll is barred from going forward in her unrelated civil action, which involves wholly different facts and claims.”\n  \n\n      Trump has denied the affair with Daniels. He has also denied sexually assaulting Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. She first sued Trump for defamation in 2019 after he denied the rape, said “she’s not my type” and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n\n  CNN’s Laura Ly and Jack Forrest contributed to this report\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Tuesday’s arraignment of former President Donald Trump was a whirlwind of historic firsts as Trump was arrested and faced the first ever criminal charges against a former US president.\n  \n\n      Now the wait begins for the long slog of the judicial system to play out, with the next scheduled actions in court months away. Away from the courthouse, however, Trump quickly went back to attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Judge Juan Merchan, along with their families – raising questions about whether his rhetoric could land him in hot water legally. \n  \n\n      Here’s what’s next in Trump’s New York criminal case:\n  \n\n      It took Trump only hours after leaving the Manhattan courtroom to go back on the attack and rail against both Bragg, the district attorney who charged him, and Merchan, the judge hearing his case.\n  \n\n      “I have a Trump-hating judge with the Trump-hating wife and family, whose daughter worked for Kamala Harris,” Trump said during a speech at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday evening.\n  \n\nTrump was indicted related to a hush money payment scheme probe. Here’s what we knowTakeaways and key lines from the indictmentREAD the full indictment and statement of factsFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment addressWho is Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA leading the historic criminal case?\n\nTrump was indicted related to a hush money payment scheme probe. Here’s what we knowTakeaways and key lines from the indictmentREAD the full indictment and statement of factsFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment addressWho is Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA leading the historic criminal case?\n\n      During Tuesday’s arraignment, prosecutors provided the judge with a packet of Trump’s social media posts, raising concerns about veiled threats he made, including posting a story that showed a photo of Trump with a baseball bat next to Bragg.\n  \n\n      Prosecutors did not attempt to place a gag order on Trump, and the judge said he was not close to considering issuing one in any event – noting that Trump had First Amendment rights both as a defendant but also as a candidate for president.\n  \n\n      “Certainly, the Court would not impose a gag order at this time even if it were requested,” Merchan said, according to a transcript. “Such restraints are the most serious and least intolerable on First Amendment rights. That does apply doubly to Mr. Trump, because he is a candidate for the presidency of the United States.” \n  \n\n      At the same time, Merchan warned both sides for witnesses and the defendant not to make comments that could incite violence or civil unrest or “jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals,” but did not say what would drive any action.\n  \n\n      Elie Honig, a former prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst, said Trump’s comments Tuesday evening indicated he was openly defying the judge with his rhetoric.\n  \n\n      “He’s almost daring the judge,” Honig said. “Ultimately though, as much as the threats and other rhetoric in my view are far over the line, I think that the judge is unlikely to impose a gag order, given the normal First Amendment concerns multiplied by Donald Trump’s ongoing candidacy.”\n  \n\n      While Trump’s attacks on Bragg mimic those he has made against the other prosecutors investigating him, his broadsides against Merchan are in a different category as the judge presiding over his case.\n  \n\n      Trump and his allies have criticized not just Merchan but also his daughter for her work for the campaigns of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n  \n\n      The judge’s daughter, Loren Merchan, has served as president of Authentic Campaigns, a firm that does digital work for Democratic candidates.\n  \n\n      The Authentic Campaigns website lists the Biden-Harris 2020 campaign and Harris’s own unsuccessful presidential primary campaign, which began and ended in 2019, among its clients. Federal campaign finance records show payments to the firm in 2020 from the Biden campaign and 2019 from the Harris primary campaign. \n  \n\n      A screenshot purporting to be from Loren Merchan’s LinkedIn page, which was captured by right-wing media outlets before her LinkedIn page was made unavailable, lists her as having worked for Harris’ primary campaign in 2019 as Director of Digital Persuasion.  \n  \n\n      While Trump has complained about the judge, his attorneys have not done so publicly. Joe Tacopina, one of Trump’s defense lawyers, said on NBC’s “Today” Wednesday that Trump’s comments about Merchan’s daughter did not constitute a threat against the judge.\n  \n\n      “That’s a relevant fact here,” Tacopina said. “It is not an attack on the judge or certainly his family. No one is suggesting that anything should happen to the judge or his family, and President Trump’s comments did not in any way, shape or form.” \n  \n\n      The political connections of Merchan’s daughter do nothing to disqualify him as a judge in the case, said CNN legal analyst Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a former chief assistant district attorney in the Manhattan district attorney’s office.\n  \n\n      “What does Biden have to do with any of this? And it’s his daughter. You can’t control your family members,” Agnifilo said. “I don’t think it even comes close to a conflict.”\n  \n\n      Loren Merchan and Authentic Campaigns did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment sent to the firm.\n  \n\n      During Tuesday’s arraignment, prosecutors said they were negotiating the logistics of a “protective order” with Trump’s defense team, which would limit how Trump and his attorneys can use the documents they will be given from the grand jury proceedings during the discovery process. \n  \n\nWhy New York's hush money case against Donald Trump is viewed as risky \n\n\n      Prosecutors specifically said they want to prohibit Trump from posting any discovery materials to social media or sharing them with third parties, such as journalists. They also said they plan to allow Trump review certain sensitive materials only with his lawyers.\n  \n\n      Trump’s attorneys will have to agree to the specifics of the agreement, but the exchanges Tuesday showed the concern in the district attorney’s office about what Trump might say or post about the evidence they hand over.\n  \n\n      “The entirety of the prosecution’s case file will soon have to be turned over to the defense,” Agnifilo said. “Prosecutors don’t want it made public because they’re focused on the proceedings and know Trump will try this in the court of public opinion way before any trial in a court. That’s where the integrity of the proceedings can get really dicey – and that’s what they’re trying to accomplish with a protective order.” \n  \n\n      If the case goes to trial, it’s not going to be until next year – when Trump could be in the thick of the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\n  \n\n      Merchan set the next hearing date in the case for December 4, nearly eight months away. Before that date, he set an August 8 deadline for Trump’s lawyers to file motions in the case, such as an attempt to get the charges dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors.\n  \n\n      Prosecutors will have until September 19 to respond, and then Merchan expects to rule on the motions at the December hearing.\n  \n\n      Prosecutors asked Merchan to plan on a trial beginning in January 2024, but Trump’s attorneys suggested that the spring might be more realistic, given they had not yet received any documents in the case.\n  \n\n      Merchan seemed to side with Trump’s lawyers.\n  \n\n      “I understand what you are saying,” Merchan said. “I think that is reasonable. You have not received discovery. It is difficult to anticipate if you will be ready for trial in January of 2024. The message I would like to deliver is we would like to move ahead as expeditiously as possible, without undue delay.”\n  \n\n  CNN’s Daniel Dale and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      As former President Donald Trump and his allies attack Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is prosecuting Trump on felony charges of falsifying business records, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing Monday in Manhattan to castigate Bragg for his handling of violent crime.\n  \n\n      But Trump and other Republicans, including committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and former Vice President Mike Pence, have made false claims about the crime situation in Manhattan and New York City. Contrary to their claims in recent weeks, neither the borough of Manhattan nor the city as a whole has been even close to a record level of crime, violent crime or murder since Bragg was sworn in as Manhattan’s top prosecutor in 2022.\n  \n\n      And Bragg’s office is correct when it points out that Manhattan has experienced declines in key crime categories so far in 2023 compared with 2022. However, it’s also true that many of Manhattan’s crime numbers increased in 2022 compared with 2021.\n  \n\n      It’s impossible to quantify how much Bragg had to do with either the 2023 decrease (it’s early in the year) or the 2022 increase (which was a continuation of a trend that began months before Bragg was elected in 2021); in general, it is extremely difficult to determine how much any jurisdiction’s crime numbers, positive or negative, can be attributed to the local district attorney. There is always a complicated mix of factors at play, from the economy to policing to the corrections system to social policy to the weather to, since 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic.\n  \n\n      “We have a tendency to want to blame one person, or credit one person, when in reality these are complex systems that rise and fall for often complex, random reasons that we don’t have the ability to explain – but it’s easier to say, ‘It was Joe Schmoe over there,’” said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and consultant and co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics.\n  \n\n      Here’s a look at what Manhattan crime numbers actually show and do not show.\n  \n\n      Trump claimed in March that Bragg “has watched Violent Crime in Manhattan soar to Record Highs” and that “killings are taking place at a number like nobody’s ever seen, right in Manhattan.”\n  \n\n      These claims are not even close to true. Manhattan’s recent levels of violent crime in general and murder in particular are way down from the record levels of the early 1990s.\n  \n\n      New York City publishes crime statistics on its website, so the truth is easy to find. In 1990, when the city set its all-time record for total murders, there were 503 recorded murders in Manhattan, which is one of the city’s five boroughs. In 2022, Manhattan recorded 78 murders – a decline of about 84% from 1990. \n  \n\n      Manhattan is also far below record levels for other kinds of crime. For example, Manhattan recorded 689 rapes in 1990, compared with about 350 rapes in 2022 (a decline of about 49%) and 26,907 robberies in 1990, compared with 4,167 robberies in 2022 (a decline of about 85%).\n  \n\n      Some Trump allies, including Jordan, have attacked Bragg with claims that there is record crime in New York City as a whole. These claims are also wildly off the mark, even if you ignore the fact that Bragg isn’t the top prosecutor in the four other boroughs. For example, New York City recorded 2,262 murders in 1990, compared with 438 in 2022, a decline of about 81%.\n  \n\n      The declines in Manhattan and New York City crime between 1990 and 2022 are even more pronounced on a per capita basis, since the population has grown over that period. Manhattan had about 1.60 million people in 2022, compared with about 1.49 million in 1990, according to Census Bureau estimates, while New York City had about 8.34 million people in 2022, compared with about 7.32 million in 1990.  \n  \n\n      Bragg’s office has responded to crime-related attacks by saying that Manhattan crime is down this year in many key categories, such as murder, shooting incidents, rape, robbery and burglary. \n  \n\n      This is accurate – and the 2023 decreases are significant, though it’s important to emphasize that it’s still early in the year and it’s unclear how much Bragg has to do with the improvements. Through April 9, Manhattan had recorded about 9% fewer murders in 2023 than it had at the same point in 2022, about 15% fewer shooting incidents, about 29% fewer rapes, about 10% fewer robberies and about 23% fewer burglaries. \n  \n\n      Bragg’s office tends not to mention that there are some categories in which Manhattan crime has increased so far this year. As of April 9, felony assault was up about 6% in 2023 over the same point in 2022, while grand larceny was up about 4%. \n  \n\n      It’s still fair for Bragg’s office to point out that various kinds of crime in Manhattan are down so far in 2023 compared with 2022. But it’s also fair to point out that various kinds of crime in Manhattan were up in 2022 compared with 2021.\n  \n\n      Rape was up about 20%, robbery about 18%, felony assault about 7%, burglary about 30%, grand larceny about 33%. Murder (down about 15%) was a major exception. On the whole, though, there was a clear uptick. \n  \n\n      There is, as always, some key context. Crime was up significantly in New York City as a whole in 2022 despite a citywide decline in murder; Bragg is not the prosecutor for the other four boroughs. Also, Asher pointed out that the upward crime trend in New York City and Manhattan began in the spring of 2021, months before Bragg was elected in the November 2021 election. He said “the timing doesn’t match up” to pin the uptick on Bragg, since “this trend clearly began before him.” And he noted that the numbers had started declining again by December 2022.\n  \n\n      “I think there’s probably a more complicated explanation” than Bragg, Asher said.\n  \n\n      It’s tricky to compare crime levels between cities for a variety of reasons, including the simple fact that where a given city’s boundaries happen to be drawn – to include or exclude quiet suburban communities – will affect its numbers.\n  \n\n      But it is clear that, where murder is concerned, New York City remained one of the safest big cities in the country per capita in 2022, as an analysis from the conservative Illinois organization Wirepoints found. The city’s murder rate in 2022 – roughly 5 murders per 100,000 people – was the third-lowest among the country’s 10 most populous cities, beating Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio and Dallas – and better than dozens of cities outside the top 10 on the population list.\n  \n\n      The list of US cities with higher murder rates than New York City in 2022 includes New Orleans, St. Louis, Baltimore, Detroit, Denver, Miami, Atlanta, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Buffalo, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Washington DC, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Memphis, Nashville, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Oakland, Sacramento, Albuquerque, Portland, Newark, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo.  \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nDonald Trump will take America through yet another grave and unprecedented national drama this week when he becomes the first ex-president to appear in court charged with a crime.\n  \n\n      The 45th president is expected to turn himself in on Tuesday in Manhattan, the stage where he built his legend as a brash popular culture figure and real estate magnate but which could now, in the case of “The People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump,” engineer his downfall.\n  \n\n      In what will be extraordinary scenes, Trump will return to New York after a grand jury voted to indict him last week in a case involving a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. His appearance, accompanied by Secret Service agents, will come as he fires up his 2024 campaign for the White House. Trump plans to make a make a speech when he gets back to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night in which he will seek to leverage political advantage out of a perilous, personal legal crisis.\n  \n\nIn between rounds of golf, Trump considers how best to use indictment as 2024 rallying cry \n\n\n      For many Americans who disdain Trump and his riotous single term, the case could be a sign that, finally, he is being called to account for his rule-crushing behavior and that everyone – even former presidents – are equal under the law. But Trump, using his bond with his most loyal supporters, is claiming the prosecution is a case of naked political persecution from District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, that’s designed to thwart the possibility of a presidential comeback. According to fundraising numbers that his campaign is touting, Trump is getting a political boost from the attention. In a new CNN/SSRS poll released on Monday, however, 60% of Americans approved of the indictment – although about three-quarters of respondents believed politics played at least some role in the decision, including 52% who said it played a major role. Among independents, 62% approved and 38% disapproved. Some 94% of Democrats approve of the indictment while 79% of Republicans disapproved.\n  \n\n      The criminal indictment takes Trump into unique political territory. And however the case turns out, his return to the spotlight in these circumstances is another twist in an exhausting saga featuring a double impeachment, false claims of a stolen election, and a mob attack on the US Congress during an unruly four-year presidency that pushed the nation to the point of exhaustion and deepened its polarization.\n  \n\n      Some legal experts, without having seen the still-sealed indictment, have questioned whether a case that appears to revolve around infringements of accounting practices and possible campaign finance violations is sufficiently serious to merit the historical step of indicting an ex-president who is already running again. \n  \n\n      At the same time, it is ultimately Trump’s norm-busting behavior that pushed the country to this somber moment. He’s also being investigated over efforts to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia, and by a special counsel probing his hoarding of classified documents and conduct in the run-up to January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. In several of these cases, Trump could face even more serious legal problems than in the Stormy Daniels matter, but that case is the only one so far that has yielded an indictment.\n  \n\n      Trump has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases. But once more, America’s political and legal systems, under a near-constant stress test since he came down the escalator in Trump Tower to launch his campaign in 2015, will be put under enormous pressure that is likely to only deepen the country’s internal estrangement.\n  \n\n      In the run-up to Tuesday’s appearance, Trump’s legal team gave a preview of a robust defense that will unfold against a backdrop of a furious political campaign. Already, his leading loyalists are seeking to use the power of the new GOP House majority to try to interfere in Bragg’s prosecution. In an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina said the ex-president’s team would loudly and proudly declare he is not guilty and signaled an attempt to try to prevent the case ever from reaching trial.\n  \n\n      “I very much anticipate a motion to dismiss coming, because there’s no law that fits this,” Tacopina said, accusing Bragg, a local prosecutor, of overstepping his powers by seeking to charge a federal election crime. Trump may have been indicted for infringing laws in New York, but since the charges haven’t been made public, it is impossible to assess his claims. CNN’s John Miller reported last week that Trump will face more than 30 counts related to business fraud.\n  \n\nTrump legal team will look to challenge 'every potential issue' once indictment is unsealed\n\n\n      While Trump’s critics have celebrated the indictment as a sign that no one is above the law, Tacopina argued that the ex-president was actually getting worse treatment than an ordinary citizen would because of his fame and political aspirations.\n  \n\n      “Had he not been running for office right now, for the office of the presidency – which, by the way, the polls have shown since this has been announced, his numbers have gone up significantly – had he not been running for presidency, he would not have been indicted,” Tacopina said. Bragg has made no public comment on the case since the indictment came down last Thursday.\n  \n\n      Tacopina also telegraphed an effort to target the credibility of Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who made a $130,000 payment to Daniels and went to prison on charges including lying to Congress, but who may be a central witness in any trial of Trump.\n  \n\n      “Michael Cohen is a pathological, convicted liar, perjurer. He’s lied to banks, the IRS, Congress,” Tacopina said. But Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, hit back, warning on “State of the Union” that a Trump defense shredding his client’s reputation would not work. “My old friend Joe Tacopina … (has) a wrong strategy if he thinks he’s building his whole strategy on personal attacks on Michael Cohen,” Davis said.\n  \n\n      While Trump’s characteristically aggressive attacks on Bragg, the judge in the case, and the Biden Justice Department might be effective in a political context, there’s no guarantee they’ll work in court. Bragg does have an exacting task in that he must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump committed crimes. But the former president is now in an new position for him – he’s subject to the rules of evidence and the schedule of a court that may be unmoved by his normal methods of attack, deflect and delay.\n  \n\n      The never-before-seen spectacle of a former president showing up for a first court appearance will transfix the nation on Tuesday. Tacopina told CNN’s Dana Bash that he was still waiting for details of what would happen. But the complexities of arraigning a former president under close Secret Service protection means that this is no ordinary case – even if justice suggests Trump should be treated like any other citizen.\n  \n\n      Intense security is already in place in New York given the political sensitivities of the case and after Trump warned of potential “death and destruction” ahead of being charged, especially given his past incitement before the Capitol insurrection. So far, however, Trump’s calls for protests have not drawn many of his supporters onto the streets.\n  \n\nInside the long and winding road to Trump's historic indictment  \n\n\n      CNN has reported that Trump was caught off guard by the grand jury’s decision to indict him, according to a person who spoke directly with him. While he was previously bracing for an indictment, he began to believe reports that a potential charge was weeks – or more – away.\n  \n\n      The indictment has already had an impact in the GOP presidential race, with leading potential challengers to Trump, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, joining the ex-president’s allies in Congress to blast the Bragg investigation as motivated by partisanship. Given Trump’s popularity with grassroots Republicans, his potential rivals may have no other move, but it would be premature to conclude that Trump’s legal problems will prove to be a long-term rallying point for GOP voters. \n  \n\n      DeSantis, who has yet to declare a run, is running a shadow campaign rooted in the premise that he could offer Trump-style policies without the chaos or distractions of the ex-president. And many Republicans are already concerned that an indicted GOP nominee could be a liability in a general election in November 2024. Another Republican, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has called on Trump to step aside because of the indictment, announced his own run for president on Sunday.\n  \n\n      In a statement on Thursday, Trump showed that he will respond to this brush with political fate in the same way he has lashed out at previous threats in his business and political career – with fury and by seeking to use his political power to stir up huge disruption and partisan anger.\n  \n\n      “I believe this Witch-Hunt will backfire massively on Joe Biden,” he said. “The American people realize exactly what the Radical Left Democrats are doing here. Everyone can see it. So our Movement, and our Party – united and strong – will first defeat Alvin Bragg, and then we will defeat Joe Biden, and we are going to throw every last one of these Crooked Democrats out of office so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n  \n\n      His approach means that this Tuesday is likely to be just the start of a new, dramatic and divisive chapter in Trump’s political career and another extreme test for America.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nFormer President Donald Trump spent the weekend before his history-making arraignment playing golf, posting on social media, meeting with advisers, and calling and texting allies to tout the political positives of his recent indictment. \n  \n\n      He disclosed fundraising numbers and internal poll numbers in these conversations, and vowed to fight the charges, according to more than half a dozen people who spoke with the former president or members of his inner circle this weekend. \n  \n\n      Despite the initial shock of the indictment that caught Trump and his advisers “off-guard,” Trump has remained surprisingly calm and focused in the days ahead of his court appearance, according to the sources. Some believed he was compartmentalizing the situation, while others believed he was convinced the case against him was weak and would only help him politically.\n  \n\n      “[Trump’s] definitely pissed off and wants to take this on aggressively, but he has been pretty low-key for Trump,” one source familiar with the former president’s recent conversations said.\n  \n\n      “As someone who has been present for a rage fit, this [response] has not been that,” another source close to Trump said, but stressed that the former president did not want to be indicted or paraded through court Tuesday. “He is being told by a lot of people that this is a weak case and he can beat it,” the source added, despite the fact that charges have not be revealed and will not be public until the indictment is unsealed.\n  \n\n      The former president has seemingly saved his rage for his social media site, escalating his attacks on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and leveling threats. Last week, Trump also went after the judge he’s expected to appear in front of on Tuesday, claiming the judge “hates” him.  \n  \n\nMeet the judge presiding over Trump's criminal arraignment\n\n\n      In between conversations with allies, the former president played golf at his Trump International Golf Course Friday, before joining his wife Melania Trump and members for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club, where he appeared quieter than usual, a source familiar with the events said, noting that Trump left the dinner scene earlier than usual that night.\n  \n\n      “[Trump] is thinking about how this can help him, sure, but he’s also spent a lot of time thinking about what this means in general, for 2024, and his future,” a source who has spoken to Trump in recent days said.\n  \n\n      On Saturday, Trump was back on the golf course, where he stepped out of the club to wave at supporters gathered across the street and had staff bring the group MAGA hats, sources said.\n  \n\n      Trump and his closest advisers spent the weekend planning out what his week would look like, and by Sunday night, the exact plan had not been finalized.\n  \n\n      “A lot of this is hinging on Secret Service,” a source familiar with the planning said, stressing that Trump and his team would follow the security guidance given to them by the agency in charge of protecting the former president.\n  \n\n      After his court appearance, Trump is expected to speak publicly Tuesday night back at Mar-a-Lago. Invitations for Trump’s address were sent to lawmakers, allies and Mar-a-Lago members Sunday night after the speech was announced. \n  \n\n      “We look forward to hosting you for this memorable and historic evening,” the invitation says, according to copies reviewed by CNN.\n  \n\n      Sources also said that Trump’s political advisers were actively discussing how to best campaign off the indictment, which they have portrayed as a political hoax and witch hunt. His team has spent the last several days presenting the former president with polls showing him with a growing lead over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, currently considered Trump’s biggest 2024 rival, in a head-to-head match up. Trump and his advisers have also enthusiastically mulled using his mugshot on t-shirts and merchandise to serve as a rallying cry for his supporters and to raise money for the campaign.\n  \n\n      But sources familiar with the preparations were uncertain as to whether a mugshot would be taken, because Trump’s appearance is widely known, there are millions of pictures of him available, and authorities were concerned about the improper leaking of a mugshot, which would be a violation of state law.\n  \n\n      After days of fundraising off the indictment, including a video plea from the former president in both an email and Truth Social post, the team released a memo from campaign heads Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita saying they had raised more than $5 million in the 48 hours following the indictment.  \n  \n\n      “Poll after poll show this political persecution by the Manhattan DA has surged overwhelming support for President Trump,” campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. “Over $5 million in donations and more than 16,000 volunteer signups since the announcement of this witch-hunt hoax are key indicators that Americans from all backgrounds are sick and tired of the weaponization of the justice system against President Trump and his supporters.”\n  \n\nMedia organizations, including CNN, seek unsealing of Trump indictment and ask to broadcast Tuesday proceedings \n\n\n      “The people know this is all political –Trump knows that,” an ally said before quickly agreeing with that sentiment. “This can only boost his support.”\n  \n\n      But not everyone agreed. “Sure, maybe this will help him in the primary,” one former Trump adviser said, pointing to what they called “Trump fatigue.”\n  \n\n      “If these indictments start piling up, there is no way this will help him – in the primary or in the general. People will get tired of it.”\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

                "content": "\n      Donald Trump appeared for a deposition Thursday as part of a high-stakes civil case brought by New York state against the former president, some of his children and his sprawling business empire.\n  \n\n      The former president answered numerous questions in the deposition with the New York attorney general’s office, a source familiar with the matter said, sitting for nearly seven hours plus breaks. \n  \n\n      The lawsuit, brought last September by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, alleges that Trump, his children Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump, and the Trump Organization were involved in an expansive scheme lasting over a decade by providing false financial statements to lenders and others that the former president used to enrich himself.  \n  \n\n      The suit is seeking $250 million and bans on the Trumps’ ability to operate a business in the state. The case is set for trial in October. The Trumps have denied wrongdoing.   \n  \n\n      The former president’s deposition is part of the discovery process of the case, and his attorney said earlier Thursday that he was prepared to answer James’ questions – a notable departure from his refusal to respond to questions from her team during a deposition that occurred a month before the suit was filed. \n  \n\n      “He remains resolute in his stance that he has nothing to conceal, and he looks forward to educating the attorney general about the immense success of his multi-billion dollar company,” Trump’s attorney, Alina Habba, said in a statement. \n  \n\n      James was in the room for at least some of the meeting, the source said.\n  \n\n      In a civil case, if a defendant asserts the Fifth Amendment, the jury can make what’s known as an “adverse inference” and place weight against Trump for refusing to answer questions.  \n  \n\n      Thursday’s appearance marked the first time Trump has been back in New York since he pleaded not guilty last week in Manhattan criminal court to 34 charges of falsifying business records following an investigation into hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.  \n  \n\n      After Trump’s first sit-down in August, the former president and his legal team have been able to glean more knowledge about the allegations against him because documents and other materials have been turned over to them.  \n  \n\n      Trump’s three children named in the case were also deposed by the attorney general’s office last year, with Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., both providing answers to prosecutors, while Eric Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right in 2020 in response to more than 500 questions. \n  \n\n      In a new campaign video released Thursday, Trump said that if elected he would appoint 100 new US attorneys to fight what he described as “Communist corruption,” as he railed against the US justice system and made baseless claims of bias by district attorneys across the nation. \n  \n\n      The former president argued district attorneys and their staff in Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles should be subpoenaed without providing any explanation or evidence for such an action. He promised to “completely overhaul the federal Department of Justice and FBI” and launch “sweeping civil rights investigations into Marxist local District Attorneys.” \n  \n\n      He also said there would be a “complete investigation into the use of police state tactics by federal authorities to arrest conservatives and Christians.”\n  \n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Carlson made no effort to press the disgraced president on any of the issues that an actual news anchor would.\n  \n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\n\n      Instead, Carlson sang Trump’s praises.\n  \n\n      “For a man caricatured as an extremist, we think you’ll find what he has to say moderate, sensible, and wise,” Carlson told his audience. At another point in his program, Carlson mocked the “Neo-con media establishment” for suggesting Trump is a “dangerous lunatic.”\n  \n\n      It was all quite a sight to see coming from a man who has been exposed to hold Trump in great disdain, as evidenced by private messages he sent which have come to light as part of Dominion Voting Systems’ $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News.\n  \n\n      Carlson actually “hate[s]” Trump. And he hates him “passionately.” He believes Trump is a “destroyer.” A “demonic force.” A president who was a “disaster.” A politician whose behavior after losing the 2020 election was “disgusting.”\n  \n\n      Carlson just doesn’t have the courage to say any of it on television — or apparently to the man whom he privately made such comments about.\n  \n\n      Carlson’s refusal to disclose to his viewers his true opinions of Trump reflect the grip the former president still exerts over the Republican Party. Even Carlson, the most popular MAGA Media figure whom most of the GOP fears, thinks it is necessary to kiss the ring of Trump.\n  \n\n      It’s a broader phenomenon reflected across Fox News, as also revealed by private messages uncovered in Dominion’s lawsuit. Even GOP kingmaker Rupert Murdoch appeared to fear Trump’s wrath. And it speaks to what could happen in 2024 and beyond.\n  \n\n      Right-wing media stars like Carlson might want to move past Trump. Carlson, himself, confided in a producer after the 2020 election, “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait.”\n  \n\n      But the reality is it will be quite difficult to ignore him now that he is once again in the race for the White House and facing criminal charges. On Tuesday night, as Carlson bowed before Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he demonstrated exactly that.\n  \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

They argued to the court that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause, which shields lawmakers from certain law enforcement actions connected to their legislative duties, prevents him from being forced to answer questions about some of the conduct that investigators are looking at. \n  \n\nNotable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023\n\n\n      “Vice President Mike Pence swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and his claim that the Biden Special Counsel’s unprecedented subpoena was unconstitutional under the Speech or Debate Clause was an important one made to preserve the Separation of Powers outlined by our Founders,” Pence spokesman Devin O’Malley said in a statement Wednesday.\n  \n\n      “Having vindicated that principle of the Constitution, Vice President Pence will not appeal the Judge’s ruling and will comply with the subpoena as required by law,” O’Malley said.\n  \n\n      “For me, the reason to challenge a subpoena of a vice president in their role as president of the Senate was an important constitutional argument to have,” Pence told reporters in late March. “And now, for the first time ever, a federal court has recognized that these protections extend to a vice president.”  \n  \n\n      The forthcoming testimony will likely elicit a strong reaction from Trump, who attempted to block Pence from appearing before the grand jury by asserting executive privilege over the former vice president’s testimony.  \n  \n\n      Trump’s legal team could still appeal a recent, sealed ruling from the district court rejecting his attempts to stop Pence from testifying about their conversations, on the basis of an executive privilege claim. There is no public indication that the Trump team has appealed that ruling. \n  \n\n      The former president has lost every executive privilege challenge he has tried to make in the investigation thus far.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\n\n      To help guide news organizations with tackling this thorny story, I reached out to a few smart members of the industry for their thoughts:\n  \n\n      ► Margaret Sullivan: “Use what we’ve learned since 2015 about covering Trump (if we really have learned!) and adjust accordingly. Weigh the newsworthiness of the moment against the likelihood of spreading his predictable lies. Fact-checking later is not nearly as effective as putting his statements in context before blasting them out raw. Remember we’re in the truth and democracy business, and let that guide the way.”\n  \n\n      ► Bill Grueskin: “My advice: Ignore the courthouse circus, and focus on the merits of the DA’s case. Is there new evidence? Are there new witnesses? What does the indictment tell us that we didn’t already know about Trump’s payment to Stormy Daniels? And what about that is provably illegal?”\n  \n\n      ► Jack Shafer: “Editors and producers should stop looking over their shoulders worrying about what the ox peckers might say about their camera angles, the number of hours they spend on the booking, the number of column inches they burn on the prosecution and trust their own journalistic instincts and training. It’s a story, follow it. Inform your readers and viewers.”\n  \n\nWhat to know about the Trump indictment on the eve of his court appearance\n\n\n      ► Susan Glasser: “I’m exhausted by the pre-spin and breathless coverage of an indictment we haven’t seen yet and Trump’s motorcade and plane flying, as if those were momentous events in their own right. The news will be what we learn about the particulars of the case and, if it’s released, the history-making mug shot of the first ever former president to be charged in a criminal case. Trump’s statements since the indictment have made news by being incendiary verging on reckless — and his evening presser is likely to offer more in this vein. In the end, most of this is likely to be a little remembered spectacle that Trump is milking for all it’s worth — and it will be the outcome of this case that will shape its place in history, and what political affect it is eventually judged to have.”\n  \n\n      ► Preet Bharara: “Don’t jump the gun. Know there will be surprises. Beware making this some Mano a Mano, Alvin Bragg versus Donald Trump story.”\n  \n\n      ► Molly Jong-Fast: “He needs to be covered as a truth sandwich. Tell the truth before you repeat one of his lies. if you can don’t repeat the lies. If you must repeat the lie be sure to say it’s a LIE. Don’t use his campaign’s framing! Don’t let him be your assignment editor. Trump is a candidate and also likely a defendant, treat him like every other candidate and defendant. Don’t give him the benefit of the doubt.”\n  \n\n      ► Alyssa Farah: “Be careful not to be spun by Trump world. Trump is currently spiraling over this indictment but he and his team will do everything in their power to try to harness the narrative and frame it as a win for him. Take a step back, contextualize this moment for history: being indicted is never a good thing and it hurts him in a general election regardless of what he says.”\n  \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

                "content": "\nThe case that Manhattan prosecutors have brought against former President Donald Trump for allegedly falsifying business records to disguise hush money payments related to the 2016 campaign presents novel legal questions that make the prosecution risky – but not impossible – legal experts say. \n  \n\n      How Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has laid out his allegations against Trump has attracted skepticism among election law scholars and white-collar defense attorneys. But other experts stress that Bragg has a case that plausibly could end in a guilty verdict and that his legal theories are on solid, albeit untested, ground. \n  \n\n      “There are some risks and complications, but I also think there’s a path to conviction,” said Cheryl Bader, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches criminal law and procedure at Fordham University School of Law.  \n  \n\nTrump was indicted related to a hush money payment scheme probe. Here’s what we knowTakeaways and key lines from the indictmentREAD the full indictment and statement of factsFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment addressWho is Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA leading the historic criminal case?\n\nTrump was indicted related to a hush money payment scheme probe. Here’s what we knowTakeaways and key lines from the indictmentREAD the full indictment and statement of factsFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment addressWho is Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA leading the historic criminal case?\n\n      Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsification of business records, which on its face is a fairly clear-cut allegation. But Bragg has brought the charges – which by themselves, are misdemeanors – as felonies. That will require his team to show that the records were falsified with the intent to conceal or further another crime, yet Tuesday’s court papers provided only a little clarity on how Bragg intends to establish an underlying crime.\n  \n\n      Prosecutors are not obligated to show their hand at this stage of the proceedings and there are minimal requirements for what an indictment must say. But given the monumental stakes of the case and how it seems to rest on a novel theory for bringing felony charges, critics say the public would have been better served with more detail. \n  \n\n      “I’m not saying there isn’t a hint of what the other crime is,” said Robert Kelner, a defense attorney who specializes in political and election law. “But when you have this weird local statute – in which to prove one crime, you have to show he intended to commit another – you think you’d be very specific.” \n  \n\n      The Manhattan hush money prosecution is not the only source of legal jeopardy for the former president and leading 2024 Republican White House candidate. In the coming weeks or months, Trump could be facing criminal charges in Georgia, stemming from a special grand jury investigation into his attempts to undermine the 2020 election. Two federal grand jury investigations being led by special counsel Jack Smith – one focused on the 2020 election subversion allegations and the other concerning White House documents that were taken to Mar-a-Lago – also present significant legal peril for Trump. \n  \n\n      “I think the Bragg case is the water pistol unnecessarily preceding the missile-launching F-35 attack piloted by Jack Smith with Merrick Garland as his wingman,” said Ty Cobb, a defense attorney who represented the Trump White House in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.\n  \n\n      The first part of the prosecutors’ case is proving that a series of Trump business records – invoices, checks and general ledger entries – were false, and here the case is straightforward, experts told CNN. \n  \n\n      Prosecutors will have physical evidence showing that the checks cut to Michael Cohen were wrongly documented as being for legal fees, when in fact he was allegedly being reimbursed for paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels.  \n  \n\n      If Bragg was bringing the charge solely as a misdemeanor, he’d need to just show that the records were falsified with the intent to defraud – another fairly easy hurdle to overcome.\n  \n\n      But Bragg has brought the 34 counts all as felonies and convincing courts, and ultimately a jury, that this is justified will be the “trickiest part” of the case, according to Paul S. Ryan, an elections law expert who is deputy executive director of the Funders’ Committee for Civic Participation.\n  \n\n      To make it a felony, prosecutors will have to point to another potential crime that Trump was trying to further or concealed when he allegedly falsified how the Cohen payments were recorded. \n  \n\n      Exactly what this underlying crime was is not specified in the indictment itself, but rather teased in an accompanying statement of facts and in prosecutors’ remarks Tuesday. They describe an “unlawful” scheme to influence the 2016 election by keeping damaging information about Trump from reaching the public. \n  \n\n      The district attorney’s theory, as well as the lack of transparency around how Bragg intends to lay it out, is raising concern about whether the case will stand up in court. \n  \n\n      Election law expert Rick Hasen told CNN it was “far from a slam dunk.” \n  \n\n      “It raises some political questions whether this is the case to bring,” said Hasen, a professor at UCLA School of Law.\n  \n\n      The complexity makes it possible that years of litigation lie ahead before the case is fully resolved.\n  \n\n      “I see this case as probably ultimately going to the [US] Supreme Court,” said John Coffee, Jr., a white-collar crime professor at Columbia Law School.  “You don’t convict an ex-president on a novel legal theory without the Supreme Court looking at it.”\n  \n\n      Manhattan prosecutors have teased three different potential underlying crimes that could support the felony charges, but each present their own assortment of novel legal questions.\n  \n\n      The first apparent argument is that the business records were falsified to conceal the federal campaign finance crimes committed with the 2016 hush money payments to women alleging extramarital affairs with Trump – crimes to which Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018. \n  \n\nThe latest on Trump's historic indictment and felony charges\n\n\n      Hasen said he was “skeptical” that a federal campaign finance prosecution could be used to back charges in a state court. Braggs’ defenders have noted that the New York false records statute seems to contemplate the commission or concealment of any crime, and therefore, they argue, it covers federal law violations. Either way, the question could be litigated in the pre-trial phase. \n  \n\n      The second potential underlying crime is a state election law Bragg referenced in his press conference: a New York misdemeanor prohibiting two or more people from conspiring to promote a candidacy by unlawful means. \n  \n\n      Election law experts are divided on whether that state crime allegation could work as the foundation for the felony. The debate centers on a legal concept known as preemption, which comes into play when the federal law appears to supersede a state law, and whether state prosecutors can go after conduct that is tied to a federal election, i.e. the 2016 presidential campaign. \n  \n\n      “Federal election law, generally speaking, preempts state election law when it comes to a governing of federal elections, except there are exceptions whereby certain state election laws can come into play,” said Jerry H. Goldfeder, a veteran election and campaign-finance lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. “Apparently [prosecutors] have looked at this seriously enough to conclude they were within their bounds.”\n  \n\n      Finally, the charging papers seem to hint that there was an intent to violate New York tax law, suggesting that rationale could be used as the backing for the felony. Under the theory, the way the Cohen reimbursements were structured in the Trump business records would give them different tax treatment than what they would have gotten had they been documented accurately. \n  \n\n      “That is state tax crimes,” Ryan Goodman, a New York University Law professor, told CNN’s Erin Burnett Tuesday night. “That is a stronger case because it is insulated from a bunch of the legal challenges, of which there are strong legal challenges to be made to election law crimes.” \n  \n\n  CNN’s Katelyn Polantz, Devan Cole and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nDonald Trump may be getting all the headlines, but partisan struggles in state capitals across the country may do far more to change America than the drama surrounding the first ex-president to be charged with a crime.\n  \n\n      Clashes between Democrats and Republicans over issues like abortion and guns, which could also shape future voting laws and electoral maps, foreshadow the great debates to come in the 2024 presidential campaign. These simmering conflicts also reflect a nation divided over its cultural and political identity and show how sometimes small shifts in the balance of power can have momentous consequences. \n  \n\n      In Wisconsin – one of the most competitive swing states in recent presidential elections – a liberal judge won a race for a state Supreme Court seat Tuesday in a victory that could restore abortion rights in the state and lead to the redrawing of maps that the GOP had shaped to their advantage. The magnitude of her victory – by around 200,000 votes – will ring alarm bells for the GOP.\n  \n\n      In North Carolina, Republicans were celebrating after a Democratic state representative, who was elected by a nearly 20-point margin a few months ago, flipped to the GOP this week, giving the party veto-proof majorities in both state legislative chambers as they seek new curbs on abortion and more restrictive election laws.\n  \n\n      America’s tortured divide on firearms is driving an extraordinary showdown in Tennessee. Instead of working to combat mass shootings after last week’s massacre at a Nashville school, Republican state legislators want to kick out three Democrats who joined a gun control protest.\n  \n\n      National Democrats are, meanwhile, looking at Chicago, where Bernie Sanders-backed progressive Brandon Johnson won Tuesday’s mayoral runoff. He beat a moderate with a tough-on-crime message by making a more nuanced pitch than his previous support for calls to “defund the police.” (Johnson said during the campaign he didn’t want to slash police funding.)\n  \n\n      And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who says his state is a laboratory for a more conservative America ahead of his possible White House bid, signed a bill into law earlier this week allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit. The state Senate also passed a highly restrictive 6-week abortion ban Monday.\n  \n\n      This remarkable series of local battles is not always noticed in Washington, where lawmakers are gearing up for a looming debt ceiling crisis and arguing about aid to Ukraine.\n  \n\n      But political brushfires that begin in states can later rage at the national level and define future general election clashes. It’s already clear, for example, that gender and transgender issues will be a dominant question in 2024, as Republicans slam Democrats for embracing policies that they describe as “woke.” \n  \n\n      The intensity of exchanges on issues like abortion, gender and guns raises another possibility. For all of Trump’s appeal to grassroots Republican voters, he is running a campaign that is almost exclusively rooted in his fury at his worsening legal problems and his claim that he is being politically persecuted to keep him out of the White House. The fights brewing in the states suggest many voters have other things on their minds.\n  \n\nWisconsin has reeled from a conservative revival and a subsequent liberal backlash ever since Republican Scott Walker was first elected governor in 2010. It was critical to the victories of Donald Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 and remains on a political knife edge heading into a new presidential election cycle. \n  \n\nRecord number of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced this year\n\n\n      In the latest political shift in the state, liberal judge Janet Protasiewicz easily beat conservative Daniel Kelly in a nonpartisan election where the parties nevertheless had clear favorites. The contest attracted significant outside spending, making it the most expensive state judicial race in history, and Protasiewicz’s winning margin was about 10 times the size of Trump and Biden’s respective cushions of around 20,000 votes. \n  \n\n      All elections are unique, but the Wisconsin judge’s victory underscores the power of abortion as a mobilizing issue and may fuel concerns among GOP strategies that the issue could again hurt their candidates in 2024. The policy effects of abortion’s galvanizing electoral force could be seen in another Midwestern battleground on Wednesday. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a repeal of the state’s 1931 abortion ban, which was possible because voters last fall handed Democrats control of both legislative chambers.\n  \n\n      Now with a liberal majority, the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to overturn a pre-Civil War law that bans abortion in nearly all circumstances, which came back into force after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Protasiewicz’s win will be a beacon of hope for Democrats who were demoralized by the loss of federal abortion rights last year.\n  \n\n      Sean Eldridge – the founder and president of Stand Up America, a progressive advocacy group – said Protasiewicz would act as a check on “conservative efforts to take away reproductive freedom, disenfranchise voters of color through racial gerrymandering, and overturn election results they don’t like. Her victory helps build a firewall for our democracy and the freedom to vote ahead of 2024.”\n  \n\n      But the lesson of Wisconsin’s turbulent political decade is that local Republicans, some of whom are in thrall to Trumpism, are likely to fight back hard. Indeed, Tuesday’s election also saw Republicans win an open state Senate seat, giving the GOP a supermajority that could be used to impeach top office holders, theoretically including Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. In an interview with WISN in Wisconsin last month, Dan Knodl – the Republican who won on Tuesday – said he would consider a move to impeach Protasiewicz. At the time, she was serving as a Milwaukee circuit court judge. It is not clear if the legislature could remove her from the Supreme Court.\n  \n\n      In another striking example of gaping political polarization, the GOP-led legislature in Tennessee is seeking the expulsion of three Democratic colleagues who led a rowdy protest on the state House floor after a mass killing of three nine-year-olds and three adults at a Christian school in Nashville. Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton described the protest as an unacceptable breach of decorum and the lawmakers have already been stripped of committee posts. The Republican speaker said the protest was “at least equivalent, maybe worse,” than the mob attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n  \n\nTennessee House Republicans take steps to remove Democratic lawmakers after they joined gun control protest\n\n\n      One of the Democratic lawmakers, state Rep. Justin Pearson, explained on CNN that he supported the protest by gun reform advocates in the public gallery because he believed voices were not being heard as they demanded action on red flag laws and other gun safety measures. Polls show a majority of Americans are in favor of tighter gun restrictions, but support varies depending on the measure in question.\n  \n\n      Pearson told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the trio knew they were breaking a House rule on decorum. “But we did not know and did not think we were doing anything that could get us expelled by exercising our First Amendment rights and encouraging those protesters and children and adults and grieving parents to do the same in the House.”\n  \n\n      The drama in the state legislature in Nashville was matched by a remarkable twist in North Carolina this week when Democratic state Rep. Tricia Cotham switched to the GOP, saying, “The modern day Democratic Party has become unrecognizable to me.” Cotham played into the Republican conceit that the rival party has gone so far left on cultural and economic issues that it has abandoned the American mainstream, although the GOP has been on its own march to the extremes. Cotham’s move comes with fraught implications for Democrats because it gives the GOP sufficient votes in each chamber to override vetoes from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.\n  \n\nNorth Carolina Democrat switches parties giving Republicans veto-proof supermajority in state House\n\n\n      Democrats accused Cotham of betraying her voters, and Cooper warned that her actions would have grave consequences. “Rep. Cotham’s votes on women’s reproductive freedom, election laws, LGBTQ rights and strong public schools will determine the direction of the state we love,” Cooper told CNN in a statement.\n  \n\n      The blows, meanwhile, keep coming for Democrats in Florida where a thumping reelection win by DeSantis last November and Republican control of the state legislature add up to total conservative dominance. As he seeks to appeal to Republican grassroots voters ahead of a possible presidential run, DeSantis this week further loosened Florida’s already permissive gun laws. And after he signed into law a 15-week abortion ban last year, the state Senate just passed a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after the gestational age of about six weeks – or about four weeks of pregnancy.\n  \n\n      The hardline abortion policy might allow DeSantis to solidify a message that he’d be a more effective conservative leader than Trump. But it’s also the kind of positioning that would offer Democrats an opening should be become the Republican nominee.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

He is a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and is currently a principal at The Raben Group, a public affairs firm. Follow him on Twitter @elliotcwilliams. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n      Last week, Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, became the first former President of the United States to face a criminal indictment. \n  \n\n      Despite Trump’s claims of selective prosecution, he will, as prosecutors and commentators have said, be treated like any other accused criminal. That won’t work out too badly for Trump, given that the “any other” here refers only to white-collar criminals.\n  \n\n      By virtue of his social standing and the crimes of which he is accused, Defendant Trump is already getting the privileged process and kid gloves extended to white-collar defendants.\n  \n\n      Like nearly all white-collar defendants, he has never been subjected to a “no-knock” search warrant, in which shouting officers appear at a property in the middle of the night and force their way in with a battering ram (perhaps ending with the defendant getting hauled into the street still in their underpants). \n  \n\n      It is a common tactic used in narcotics investigations designed to catch subjects off guard and prevent them from destroying or concealing evidence — ironically, conduct Trump himself may eventually be accused of.\n  \n\n      Likewise, news of the coming indictment dropped on a Thursday and spread quickly on a Friday. Luckily for Trump, he wasn’t immediately arrested and detained through the weekend — a routine practice for defendants who cannot afford to post their bond and have the misfortune of getting nabbed as court personnel head home for the weekend.\n  \n\n      He had an opportunity to negotiate his surrender and will not be detained before his trial, a means of ensuring a defendant’s appearance. The practice is typically used for defendants deemed to pose either a risk of fleeing the jurisdiction or a danger to their community. Based on the crimes for which he has been charged, not even Trump’s calls to “take our nation back,” warnings about “death & destruction” that could follow, or personal attacks on judges or prosecutors would be sufficient to require his pretrial detention in New York; the state requires release unless a defendant presents a risk of flight to avoid prosecution. \n  \n\n      Even a white-collar defendant’s photograph of himself holding a baseball bat next to a prosecutor’s photo might be easily dismissed as indecorous, but free, speech. A member of a street gang who posted the same image would have, in many courts, bought himself a ticket to jail.\n  \n\n      It’s not that we should treat white-collar defendants worse, but many other defendants better.\n  \n\nOpinion: Why the Manhattan district attorney's case against Trump is so weak\n\n\n      Of course, there are justifiable accommodations that need to be made for a defendant in the full-time protection of the Secret Service. For instance, a former president being handcuffed or kept in a cell outside the presence of his security detail presents safety and even national security concerns. \n  \n\n      Still, many protections that the system builds in for white-collar defendants — all revolving around notice of the actions that will be taken against them and opportunity to order their personal affairs — stem from a belief that white-collar crime isn’t all that much of a public threat.\n  \n\n      The concept is not new. In 1939, sociologist Edwin Sutherland first coined the term “white-collar crime,” later describing it as “a crime committed by a person of high social status and respectability in the course of his occupation,” a definition that almost apologizes to white-collar criminals for the pesky inconvenience of criminal accusation. \n  \n\n      While today our laws typically frame criminality in terms of specific acts committed, old habits die hard. The image of a (usually White, usually wealthy) man in a business suit simply does not conjure what we think of when we hear the words “criminal defendant.” Cufflinks, not handcuffs, seem more natural on his wrists.\n  \n\n      White-collar defendants routinely argue that the stigma they may face, as prominent members of society, ought to affect the treatment they receive. Consider Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen’s argument at his own sentencing that the loss of his law license and business “amount[ ] to an alternative form of punishment,” or former campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s claim that his criminal ordeal “ruined his reputation.” Both play into the notion that white-collar defendants in the system have suffered enough. Judges often agree.\n  \n\n      Moreover, the FBI calculated the annual cost of street-level “property” crime — including larceny, burglary and theft — in 2018 to be around $16 billion. This is a rounding error compared to the $426 billion to $1.7 trillion estimated to be the annual cost of white-collar crime. Even if no blood is shed in a misdemeanor white-collar crime, it can come with a profound social cost. Still, guess which defendant is far more likely to sit in jail for months prior to his trial — either because the law requires it, or because he can’t afford to pay to get himself out?\n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      Certainly, not all crimes, or offenders, should be treated the same. Having spent years as both a prosecutor and senior leader at the Justice Department, I am well aware that some conduct poses a far greater public safety threat than others, and should be dealt with aggressively.\n  \n\n      However, in deciding on the dignity and latitude extended to defendants throughout the process, society could rethink its notions of what we mean when we think of “threat,” given that not all conduct that destroys our social order is physically violent. We could recognize that most who enter the criminal justice system, white-collar or not, have reputations, livelihoods and families to protect. \n  \n\n      We can take prosecutors at their word that Trump will be treated like every other defendant. Given how society coddles white-collar criminals, he should delight in that.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

                "content": "\n      Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis met behind closed doors with a select group of congressional Republicans on Tuesday evening in Washington as he seeks support from within his party to challenge Donald Trump for the GOP nomination in 2024.\n  \n\n      He was coy about his future presidential ambitions and did not divulge details of when he might formally enter the race, multiple Republican lawmakers told CNN as they left the event. But he admitted in private conversations with members that he’s seriously considering a bid.  \n  \n\n      “I’ve known Mr. DeSantis for years,” said one attendee, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who served with him as a member of the House Freedom Caucus. “Look, he’s been a tremendous success in Florida and perhaps he’s gonna choose to do that for the United States.”  \n  \n\n      But while many members who attended Tuesday’s meeting consistently lauded DeSantis and his work in Florida, they also refused to offer their endorsement of him – at least this early on, telling CNN they plan to reserve their judgment until later in the primary. \n  \n\n      “No, I’m not [endorsing] at this point,” said Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado. “It’s an honor to see him. And I think it’s great that he’s here. … it’s gonna be a good group of people who run that will give Republicans a good choice.”  \n  \n\n      Rep. Bob Good of Virginia told CNN, “I think he’s America’s governor. He’s done an outstanding job and the people of Florida rewarded him with a 20-point win. He’s an example to everybody.” But the Virginia Republican refused to say whether he’d considered an endorsement. \n  \n\n      The trip brought DeSantis to the doorstep of an institution in which he served for nearly three terms – an experience he detested, according to his recent book. He called Congress a “grotesque” place where “members are focused not on accomplishing anything meaningful” and boasted about his lack of effort climbing the leadership ladder or building alliances.\n  \n\n      “I was also not there to socialize, let alone be a fixture on the DC social circuit,” he wrote in “The Courage to be Free.”\n  \n\n      But now, on the precipice of a 2024 presidential campaign, DeSantis’ lack of inroads there are sending troubling signals to political supporters. Hours ahead of his meeting with congressional Republicans, Florida Rep. John Rutherford endorsed Trump, making him the sixth House Republican to back the former president over their home state governor. Additionally, Florida Rep. Brian Mast told CNN ahead of the meet-and-greet that he planned to back Trump.\n  \n\n      NBC reported last week that DeSantis’ political operation was scrambling to convince Florida Republicans not to endorse until after he had formally decided to run.\n  \n\n      Florida Rep. Greg Steube, who endorsed Trump on the eve of the governor’s visit to Washington, told the Sarasota Herald Tribune five days ago that DeSantis’ team had attempted contact with him, yet added: “When we are ready to endorse a candidate for president, we will.” \n  \n\n      The attempt to slow momentum for Trump began in earnest after Rep. Byron Donalds announced he was getting behind the former president, according to sources close to undecided Florida Republicans. That endorsement “sent shockwaves through the entire Florida delegation,” one source said, because Donalds was considered the closest to DeSantis of any House Republican in the state. Donalds had introduced DeSantis at his victory rally on Election Night last year.\n  \n\n      “When Donalds came out, that sent a message to other members, ‘What are we missing? What is going on?’” the source said.\n  \n\n      Rep. Laurel Lee, a former Florida secretary of state under DeSantis, backed the governor on Tuesday ahead of his visit. \n  \n\n      “DeSantis fights for what matters,” she said, “and he wins when it matters most.”\n  \n\n      A spokesman for DeSantis’ political operation did not return a call or email.\n  \n\n      Congressional endorsements are hardly the barometer by which voters choose their nominees. If such was the case, Trump would not have won the GOP primary race in 2016.\n  \n\n      But by plucking support from within DeSantis’ backyard, Trump has created the impression that even Republicans close to DeSantis may be having second thoughts about his performance. \n  \n\n      “I think it only matters if Trump makes it matter,” said ex-Rep. David Jolly, a former Republican who served alongside DeSantis. “Which clearly he is,” Jolly added.\n  \n\n      DeSantis throughout his career has relished the outsider image he cultivated while working in Washington. He slept in his office, went home most weekends and often walked Congress’ cavernous tunnels with earbuds in. Instead of aligning himself with Florida Republicans or GOP leadership, he helped form the Freedom Caucus, a conservative group of lawmakers that has at times created headaches for the party. \n  \n\n      When Florida’s delegation would meet to strategize on legislation, DeSantis was known to sit in the back of the chamber talking on his phone.\n  \n\n      “I don’t remember a single Florida delegation meeting he attended,” Jolly said. “We had lunch once a month, just casually to just catch up. I’m not sure he ever attended a single one. He was not a team player. It doesn’t surprise me that he doesn’t have much loyalty in the delegation.”\n  \n\n      But while he was once a little-known congressional backbencher, DeSantis as governor has become Florida’s most popular and powerful elected leader, outshining many of the Republicans he once served by leaning into cultural clashes that have animated the GOP faithful in the years since Trump left office. \n  \n\n      Ahead of the visit, DeSantis escalated his fight with Disney over a state bill that restricts the teaching of certain LGBTQ topics, suggesting that the state could build a prison or competing theme park next to the entertainment giant’s iconic theme parks and threatening legislation to ensure a state takeover of the company’s special taxing district. His political operation, meanwhile, released a parody Bud Light commercial making fun of transgender athletes. \n  \n\n      Surveys of GOP voters continue to show that DeSantis is Trump’s chief rival for the nomination, often leading the rest of the field by double digits. \n  \n\n      DeSantis met Tuesday night with, among others, Reps. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Randy Feenstra and Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, Dan Crenshaw of Texas and Andy Barr of Kentucky. Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and Lee of Florida – all of whom have endorsed DeSantis – were also seen. Among the Trump-backers in attendance were Rutherford and Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas, who endorsed the former president shortly after leaving the meeting. Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah were also there.\n  \n\n      DeSantis will also visit the DC area on Friday for a speech at the Heritage Foundation 50th anniversary leadership summit, an organization that has showered Florida’s leader with praise throughout his years in office. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting. \n\n\n  CNN’s From Alyana Treene, Kit Maher and Melanie Zanona contributed this story.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are exemplifying the lengths they are willing to go to discredit Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s criminal case against former President Donald Trump with a Monday New York field hearing on Bragg’s home turf. \n  \n\n      House Republicans are seeking to make the case that Bragg is more focused on going after Trump for political reasons than addressing crime in New York City, a claim Bragg vehemently denies. \n  \n\n      Democrats are pushing back, arguing that Republicans are acting as an extension of Trump’s defense team and saying they should focus instead on public safety issues like gun violence. A spokesperson for the Manhattan DA’s office said in a statement ahead of the hearing that the event is a “political stunt.”\n  \n\n      The hearing, billed as focusing on crime in New York, comes as the legal drama between Bragg and House Republicans has intensified in recent days. Bragg sued House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan and sought to block him from taking certain investigative steps, arguing that Congress doesn’t have oversight authority over state-level criminal prosecutions.\n  \n\nFact check: Here's the truth about crime in Manhattan\n\n\n      It serves as the latest example of how Trump continues to wield enormous power on Capitol Hill as House Republicans seek to curry favor with the former president, coming to his defense through their investigations and routinely updating him and his closest advisers on their progress. In the wake of his indictment, Trump called up members of House GOP leadership and key committee members to shore up support on Capitol Hill, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. \n  \n\n      House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan opened Monday’s hearing by going after Bragg for being “soft on crime.”\n  \n\n      “Here in Manhattan, the scales of justice are weighed down by politics. For the District Attorney, justice isn’t blind. It’s about looking for opportunities to advance a political agenda, a radical political agenda rather than enforcing the law,” Jordan said in his opening remarks.\n  \n\n      Despite the claims from top Republicans, Manhattan’s current levels of both violent crime in general and murder in particular are down significantly from the record levels of the early 1990s. \n  \n\n      While there was an uptick in many types of crime in Manhattan in 2022 compared to 2021, a number of crimes have come back down significantly in 2023. Bragg took office as Manhattan DA in 2022. \n  \n\n      Monday’s hearing will be the first in a series of field hearings focusing on crime in Democratic-run cities, a source familiar with Republicans’ plans told CNN.   \n  \n\n      Democrats, meanwhile, will argue at the hearing that if Republicans truly cared about violent crime, they would not have held the hearing in Manhattan, where crime is lower compared with other New York City boroughs, and, beyond that, would be focusing on crime in rural areas, a source familiar with Democrats’ plans tells CNN. \n  \n\n      Committee Democrats will also try to pivot the conversation to gun violence, the source added, and argue that Republicans have refused to work on gun legislation even though mass shootings continue to ravage the country. Prior to the hearing, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary panel, and gun safety advocates held a news conference.\n  \n\n      Nadler said ahead of the hearing, “this hearing is being called for one reason, and one reason only: to protect Donald Trump.”\n  \n\n      “Jim Jordan and his Republican accomplices are acting as an extension of the Trump defense team … that is an outrageous abuse of power” Nadler said.\n  \n\n      Monday’s event marks the first time that Democrats on the committee have joined a field hearing in this session of Congress.\n  \n\n      Both sides also lobbied to get additional members added to the hearing, a standard practice, but a move that underscores each party’s desire to bring in additional voices to help articulate their respective message. Judiciary Republicans added to their side of the dais House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, who represents a district in upstate New York. \n  \n\n      “I look forward to holding Democrats accountable for their failure to prosecute crimes and instead engage in illegal political witch-hunts against their political opponents,” Stefanik said in a statement to CNN. The New York Republican is among the GOP lawmakers in contact with Trump since he was indicted, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. \n  \n\n      New York Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat will also join Monday’s field hearing. In a joint statement, the pair argued that through this hearing Republicans are trying to “interfere in an ongoing criminal investigation.”\n  \n\n      Witnesses at the field hearing underscored the larger arguments each party has been seeking to make.\n  \n\n      Many of the witnesses called by Republicans spoke first-hand about the crime and violence they have experienced in New York as they criticized Bragg for not prosecuting crimes aggressively enough.\n  \n\n      Those called by House Democrats pointed to statistics that show crime in New York City is declining, argued that Republicans do not want to address gun legislation, and claimed that Republicans are holding the hearing for political purposes.  \n  \n\n      A Democratic member of the New York City Council called by Republicans on the panel, Robert F. Holden, said, “71 years I’ve lived here in New York City.  I’ve seen bad times, high crimes … I’ve not seen the lawlessness that I’m seeing today in New York City in my lifetime.”\n  \n\n      A number of witnesses called by the Republican side criticized Bragg for a memo he released early in his tenure – some of which has since been revised – that instructed prosecutors to avoid seeking jail time for a number of serious crimes.\n  \n\n      The Founder of Victims Rights NY,  Jennifer Harrison, said, “from day one, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced he would not prosecute even very violent crimes in his now infamous memo. We saw an immediate result.”\n  \n\n      Meanwhile, in a line of questioning led by Nadler, Third Way’s Executive Vice President for Policy, Jim Kessler, outlined how the crime rate in New York City is less than the national average and even less than Ohio, where Jordan lives.\n  \n\n      As a result, Democratic Rep. David Cicilline made a request to move Monday’s hearing to Ohio, which was quickly rejected.\n  \n\n      Executive Director for New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, Rebecca Fischer, called by the Democrats, argued that gun violence in New York was the result of the lack of action on a national level.\n  \n\n      “The national gun trafficking crisis is largely the result of weak gun laws in other states, and the fact that Congress has not enacted federal gun violence prevention reforms” Fischer said.\n  \n\n      Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, meanwhile, began her questioning by calling out violent crime but saying that Congress does not have jurisdiction over crime in New York.\n  \n\n      “Let me just say all of us on this committee, no matter our party, are opposed to crime and all of us have sympathy for victims of crime” Lofgren said. “But I will say also that we don’t have jurisdiction. The federal government does not have jurisdiction over state and local prosecutions. That’s up to the voters of each state and each locality.”\n  \n\n      Bragg has pushed back on the GOP’s efforts to investigate his criminal probe, claiming in his lawsuit, “Congress lacks any valid legislative purpose to engage in a free-ranging campaign of harassment in retaliation for the District Attorney’s investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump under the laws of New York.”\n  \n\n      The district attorney also took aim at Republicans for interfering in an ongoing criminal case, writing that “rather than allowing the criminal process to proceed in the ordinary course, Chairman Jordan and the Committee are participating in a campaign of intimidation, retaliation, and obstruction.”\n  \n\n      Bragg asked the court to block the Judiciary committee’s subpoena for testimony from a former senior prosecutor in his office, Mark Pomerantz. Pomerantz resigned from the DA’s office in 2022, after Bragg said he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges against Trump. Pomerantz, in his resignation letter, said Trump was “guilty of numerous felony violations” related to his annual financial statements.\n  \n\n      House Republicans urged a federal judge to reject the Manhattan district attorney’s office request to block a subpoena for testimony from a former prosecutor, saying such a move would impede their own investigation. \n  \n\n      Lawyers for Jordan also argue they are immune from Bragg’s lawsuit under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution which protects lawmakers from being sued for actions stemming from their legislative actions.\n  \n\n      Jordan has also demanded documents and testimony from Bragg, as well as information from another former prosecutor from his office, as part of Jordan’s congressional probe. The engagement from Bragg’s office has so far staved off a congressional subpoena for now. \n  \n\n      Republicans have seized on Pomerantz’s previous comments as a sign that the 34 felony criminal charges brought against Trump this year in Manhattan were politically motivated. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n  \n\n      House Republicans have made the Manhattan District Attorney’s office use of federal funds the crux of their justification for why they have jurisdiction over Bragg’s case. \n  \n\n      Bragg’s office disclosed in a recent letter that out of the more than one billion dollars in asset forfeiture funds it helped the federal government secure, approximately $5,000 was spent on expenses relating to Trump or the Trump organization between October 2019 and August 2021, but maintains that no federal grant money was used toward expenses in the Trump investigation.\n  \n\n      Republicans have seized on this revelation, and have already started introducing legislation pertaining to Bragg. \n  \n\n      House GOP Rep. Russell Fry of South Carolina introduced legislation in the House last week that would allow former and current presidents and vice presidents the ability to move their own criminal or civil cases from state court to a federal court. GOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona introduced a pair of bills, one of which would defund the Manhattan District Attorney’s office.\n  \n\n      In his lawsuit, Bragg claimed House Republicans have “manufactured new supposed legislative objectives.”\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n\n  CNN’s Kara Scannell contributed. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

The grand jury is hearing evidence as part of a special counsel’s criminal investigation.\n  \n\n      Miller’s appearance at the federal courthouse Tuesday morning – alongside his lawyer and prosecutors from the office of special counsel Jack Smith – adds to a parade of witnesses the 2020 election investigators have secured in recent weeks. \n  \n\n      Miller and his attorney declined to comment Tuesday.\n  \n\n      Late last month, the chief judge overseeing the grand jury denied Trump’s attempts to protect his presidential communications from investigators, prompting witnesses like Miller, who previously avoided answering some questions, to testify again. \n  \n\n      Miller previously appeared before the grand jury in November. At that time, CNN reported that he declined to answer some questions because of Trump’s wish to assert executive privilege and protect the secrecy of some of their conversations during his presidency.\n  \n\n      In his separate interview with House January 6 investigators, Miller declined to share details about conversations with Trump related to the then-president’s unwillingness to concede the election if he lost and the discussions they had about speeches Miller prepared after the election, according to a publicly available transcript. \n\n\n      The House investigation found that after the call between Miller and Trump the morning of January 6, Miller added in “POTUS edits” to Trump’s Ellipse speech that included a mention of then-Vice President Mike Pence having the ability to overturn the election result – a power Pence himself believed he didn’t have.\n  \n\n      “We will see whether Mike Pence enters history as a truly great and courageous leader. All he has to do is refer the illegally-submitted electoral votes back to the states,” the draft read. Another White House adviser then asked Miller to remove the Pence reference from the speech’s text. Pence and Trump then had an angry phone call, and the speechwriting team reinserted a line about Pence. \n  \n\n      Criminal investigators from the special counsel’s office have been pursuing questions about Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence, and they’re securing testimony about it from a number of witnesses in recent weeks. Pence himself could testify as soon as this week.\n  \n\n      The grand jury proceedings are secret, and the special counsel’s office hasn’t filed any charges. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

They began to get the documents last week. \n  \n\n      A source familiar with the process tells CNN the Gang of Eight began getting access to Biden, Pence and Trump’s classified documents “in a rolling production” last week. The Biden administration is giving the group access to the documents “in tranches” and not all at once, according to the source.\n  \n\n      For several months, leaders of the intelligence committees have been pushing for more information about the kinds of documents found, offering harsh criticism for the lack of information they received early on. \n  \n\n      The argument from top lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee has been that they needed to understand the contents and extent of the documents found at each residence in part to understand the potential damage that could be unfurled if the documents had fallen into the wrong hands and if proper mitigation protocols had been followed.\n  \n\n      In January, Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, and Vice Chairman Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, blasted the administration for the lack of transparency over the documents and what they were.\n  \n\n      “We simply want to know what was this information,” Rubio said at the time. “What (were) these materials that they had? So that we can make an honest assessment when they provide us a risk assessment, of whether or not they’ve taken the proper mitigation if any was necessary.”\n  \n\n      Warner, in recent weeks, had an at-times heated phone conversation with Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco on the lack of congressional access to the classified documents found in the possession of Biden, Trump and Pence, two sources familiar with the call tell CNN. \n  \n\n      Warner and Rubio have applied considerable public pressure on the DOJ to grant access to the documents.\n  \n\n      Republican Rep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News Tuesday morning, “it is very disappointing that it has taken the government this long to allow the Gang of Eight to have access” to the classified documents.\n  \n\n      Punchbowl was first to report that that administration has begun giving the Gang of Eight access to the documents. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n\n  CNN’s Zack Cohen and Ted Barrett contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Former top national security officials have told prosecutors and testified to a federal grand jury that they repeatedly told former President Donald Trump and his allies that the government didn’t have the authority to seize voting machines after the 2020 election, CNN has learned. \n  \n\n      Ken Cuccinelli, the former second in command at the Department of Homeland Security, was asked about discussions inside the administration around DHS seizing voting machines when he appeared before the grand jury earlier this year, according to three people familiar with the proceedings. Cuccinelli testified that he “made clear at all times” that DHS did not have the authority to take such a step, one of the sources said.\n  \n\n      Cuccinelli’s former boss at DHS, ex-acting secretary Chad Wolf, met with Justice prosecutors and FBI officials earlier this year after receiving a grand jury subpoena from special counsel Jack Smith’s team, according to Wolf’s lawyer John Coale. Wolf told prosecutors that after the 2020 election he was asked by White House officials if DHS had legal authority to seize voting machines and each time he said no, Coale told CNN.\n  \n\n      Trump’s former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, in a closed-door interview with federal prosecutors earlier this year, also recounted conversations about seizing voting machines after the 2020 election, including during a heated Oval Office meeting that Trump participated in, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n  \n\n      Details about the secret grand jury testimony and closed-door interviews, neither of which have been previously reported, illustrate how special counsel Smith and his prosecutors are looking at the various ways Trump tried to overturn his electoral loss despite some of his top officials advising him against the ideas.  \n  \n\n      Now some of those same officials, including Wolf, Cuccinelli and O’Brien, as well as others who have so far refused to testify, may have to return to the grand jury in Washington, DC, to provide additional testimony after a series of pivotal court rulings that were revealed in recent weeks rejected Trump’s claims of executive privilege. \n  \n\n      Cuccinelli was spotted going back into the grand jury on Tuesday, April 4.\n  \n\n      Without that privilege shield, former officials must answer questions about their interactions and conversations with the former president, including what he was told about the lack of evidence for election fraud and the legal remedies he could pursue. \n  \n\nSpecial counsel is locked in at least 8 secret court battles in Trump investigations\n\n\n      That line of questioning goes to the heart of Smith’s challenge in any criminal case he might bring – to prove that Trump and his allies pursued their efforts despite knowing their fraud claims were false or their gambits weren’t lawful. To bring any potential criminal charges, prosecutors would have to overcome Trump’s public claim that he believed then and now that fraud really did cost him the election.\n  \n\n      “There’s lots of ways you can show that. But certainly one of them is if they were told by people who knew what they were talking about, that that there was no basis to take the actions,” said Adav Noti, an election law attorney who previously served in the US Attorney’s Office in Washington, DC, and at the Federal Election Commission’s general counsel’s office. \n  \n\n      “I would not want to be a defense lawyer trying to argue, ‘Well, yes, my client was told that, but he never really believed it,’” Noti said.  \n\n\n      Inside the Trump White House after the 2020 election, the push to seize voting machines eventually led to executive orders being drafted in mid-December of that year, directing the military and DHS to carry out the task despite Wolf and Cuccinelli telling Trump and his allies their agency did not have the authority to do so. \n  \n\nThose orders, which cited debunked claims about voting system irregularities in Michigan and Georgia, were presented to Trump by his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then-lawyer Sidney Powell during a now-infamous Oval Office meeting on December 18.   \n  \n\n      Smith’s team has asked witnesses about that meeting in front of the grand jury and during closed-door interviews, multiple sources told CNN. Among them was O’Brien, who told the January 6 House select committee that he was patched into the December 18 meeting by phone after it had already devolved into a screaming match between Flynn, Powell and White House lawyers, according to a transcript of O’Brien’s deposition that was released by the panel.\n  \n\n      O’Brien told the committee that at some point someone asked him if there was evidence of election fraud or foreign interference in the voting machines. “And I said, ‘No, we’ve looked into that and there’s no evidence of it,” O’Brien said he responded. “I was told we didn’t have any evidence of any voter machine fraud in the 2020 election.” \n  \n\n      When asked about that meeting by federal prosecutors working for Smith, O’Brien reiterated that he made clear there was no evidence of foreign interference affecting voting machines, according to the source familiar with the matter. \n  \n\n      O’Brien met with prosecutors earlier this year after receiving a subpoena from Smith’s team and is among the Trump officials who could be called back to discuss conversations with Trump under the judge’s recent decision on executive privilege.\n  \n\n      Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who personally told allies of the former president that there was no evidence of foreign election interference or widespread fraud that would justify taking extreme steps like seizing voting machines, must also testify, the judge decided. \n  \n\n      A spokesperson for Ratcliffe did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Wolf declined to comment. \n  \n\n      Cuccinelli acknowledged to the January 6 committee last year that, after the election, he was asked several times by Trump’s then-attorney Rudy Giuliani, and on at least one occasion by Trump himself, if DHS had authority to seize voting machines. Wolf told the committee he was repeatedly asked the same question by then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. \n  \n\n      Giuliani, who was subpoenaed by the Justice Department before Smith took over the investigation, previously acknowledged to the January 6 committee that he participated in that December 18 Oval Office meeting and other conversations about having DHS and the military seize voting machines.\n  \n\nNewly obtained surveillance video shows fake Trump elector escorted operatives into Georgia county's elections office before voting machine breach\n\n\n      Giuliani told congressional investigators that he and his team “tried many different ways to see if we could get the machines seized,” including options involving DHS, according to the transcript of his committee interview. Giuliani also acknowledged taking part in conversations – even before the Dec. 18 Oval Office meeting – where the idea of using the military to seize voting machines was raised.\n  \n\n      “I can remember the issue of the military coming up much earlier and constantly saying, ‘Will you forget about it, please? Just shut up. You want to go to jail? Just shut up. We’re not using the military,’” he added.\n  \n\n      Robert Costello, an attorney for Giuliani, told CNN that Giuliani has not received a subpoena from Smith. Costello said that in early November, Giuliani was subpoenaed by the DC US Attorney seeking documents and testimony. Costello says he told the Justice Department Giuliani couldn’t comply with the given deadlines because they were in the middle of disciplinary proceedings at the time. That was the last time Giuliani heard from DOJ, says Costello.\n  \n\n      “I haven’t heard a word since November 2022,” Costello told CNN on March 30.\n  \n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story reported that Chad Wolf had appeared before a federal grand jury. After publication Wolf’s attorney told CNN that Wolf met with Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI after receiving a grand jury subpoena from special counsel Jack Smith but has not yet testified before the grand jury itself.\n\n\n  CNN’s Paula Reid contributed to this report\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

He is also a former senior policy adviser to Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed in this piece are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n      For a while, the fight for the Republican Party’s nomination in 2024 was looking like a two-man race. If you believe the polls, it currently seems like it’s down to one. \n  \n\n      Former President Donald Trump has inarguably benefited from a rally-round-the-flag effect from his recent indictment. It seems Republican primary voters love few things better than sticking a finger in the eye of the political establishment, and there’s no better way to signal that than telling pollsters they’re planning on supporting Trump in his 2024 reelection bid. \n  \n\n      But the race for the nomination is far from over. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was neck and neck with the former president just a few months ago, may have lost a step or two in more recent polling. But his track record of successful governance in Florida should force GOP voters to think long and hard about what version of their party they want to put forward. \n  \n\n      A third Trump presidential nomination would indicate that Republican primary voters may prefer style over substance. But if they are serious about not just making liberals mad but advancing actual policy, GOP voters should consider other names, starting with the Florida governor. \n  \n\n      DeSantis offers Republicans most everything they should want — at least on paper. A politically successful governor who helped turn a purple state red, stood up to what he called “woke” corporations and passed meaningful legislation to improve the lives of Florida citizens should be the type of candidate that GOP primary voters swoon over. \n  \n\nDeSantis takes a risk on Trump\n\n\n      DeSantis is also starting to build important connective tissue around his expected run. Without even announcing his candidacy, he has picked up endorsements from conservative stalwart Rep. Chip Roy of Texas and libertarian firebrand Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky.\n  \n\n      In revamping the board of the New College of Florida, he appointed well-connected conservatives such as anti-critical race theory activist Christopher Rufo of the Manhattan Institute and Charles Kesler, editor of the Claremont Review of Books. Recognizing key figures and institutions on the right in this way suggests a DeSantis administration would be serious about delivering on conservative principles. \n  \n\n      And in addition to high-profile culture war fights, he’s put together a list of legislative accomplishments. He signed an “education freedom” program, helping to give parents the opportunity to find the school environment that best fits their child. His efforts to give parents more of a say in their children’s classrooms drew controversy, but he stuck to his guns.\n  \n\nWisconsin sends an undeniable warning to the GOP\n\n\n      He also signed laws banning rent control by local governments and offering down payment assistance for police, teachers and military personnel; increased environmental protections and teacher pay; slashed tolls and sales taxes on certain items including diapers; and expanded funding for apprenticeship training programs.\n  \n\n      And, in a few days, he could solidify his reputation as a governor with impeccable conservative credentials. The “Heartbeat Protection Act,” a ban on abortion in Florida after six weeks’ gestation, would mark a tremendous commitment to the socially conservative wing of the party. Moderates in the GOP may prefer he veto the bill, but DeSantis’ track record would reach new heights if he used his political capital to make meaningful gains in restricting abortion in the Sunshine State.\n  \n\n      In short, DeSantis offers Republicans a glimpse into what a successful conservative approach to governing could look like. It remains to be seen what sort of national agenda he would put forward to build on his success — staying open during the pandemic and developing a thriving tourism economy have helped Florida boom — but this approach is a harder model to export to the critical Rust Belt states. \n  \n\n      Like any politician, DeSantis isn’t perfect. He fumbled his attempt to navigate the GOP’s hawkish and dovish sides on the war in Ukraine, and even those who like him admit his stage presence lacks the charisma of other, more skilled politicians. And if DeSantis struggles to transition from Florida to the national stage, the likelihood of Trump winning the GOP nomination once again would increase, although it still wouldn’t be a foregone conclusion. \n  \n\nThe fight against 'woke' is really conservative gaslighting\n\n\n      Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the United Nations, has yet to catch political fire, but another South Carolinian is stockpiling key campaign veterans and making travel plans for Iowa and New Hampshire. Sen. Tim Scott, though not a favorite of ideological true believers, seems intent on taking his optimistic vision for an “opportunity agenda” to the voters. \n  \n\n      Scott’s earnest, if sound-bite heavy, optimism and DeSantis’ dogged, if charmless, record of substantive and political wins would both contrast with a Trump 2024 campaign focused on his personal grievances and political retribution. (Other would-be candidates, such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, will likely find the two-step of criticizing the man they once gladly worked for too difficult to pull off convincingly.) \n  \n\n      While Trump piqued some interest in announcing a focus on chartering “freedom cities,” flying cars and baby bonuses, the motivating impulse behind his campaign remains what it has always been — the former real estate developer against his many enemies, real and perceived. \n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      In the wake of the former president’s recent indictment in New York, his campaign has been rewarding donors with T-shirts emblazoned with a mocked-up mug shot of Trump, reminding the world that the central protagonist in a Trump reelection bid would be the former president himself. In his promise of “retribution” and his fixation on the 2020 election, Trump is a known quantity — one that excites his supporters and turns off moderates. \n  \n\n      If GOP voters decide their primary operating principle is to enrage the media and “own the libs,” they will nominate Trump. But if the party is serious about delivering on its rhetoric of a more pro-family, pro-worker focus — and is clear-eyed about the electoral limitations of Trump’s MAGA style and approach — it will soon have another alternative staring it in the face. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      First, the Shasta County Board of Supervisors in rural northern California voted to cancel its contract with Dominion Voting Systems, citing public distrust of the company’s machines.\n  \n\n      Then, the supervisors agreed to shift to hand-counting ballots in future elections after receiving written assurance from one of the most vocal 2020 election deniers – MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell – that he would provide “financial and legal” resources to the county if it faced “pushback” over the move.\n  \n\n      The decision by a majority of supervisors in this deeply conservative county to end the Dominion contract – years before its expiration date and over the objection of the county’s top election official – illustrates how the attacks against the company continue to reverberate more than two years after the 2020 election. Dominion is preparing to face off in the coming days against Fox News in a Delaware courtroom in a high-profile $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit. Dominion claims the network “recklessly disregarded the truth” by peddling conspiracies advanced by former President Donald Trump and his allies about its voting systems. Fox News has denied any wrongdoing.\n  \n\n      Dominion has also sued Lindell and Trump-aligned attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, along with two smaller right-wing networks, Newsmax and One America News Network. Each lawsuit offers detailed rebuttals of the conspiracy theories that have flourished in pockets of the country and conservative media circles ever since Trump and his allies began pushing claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n  \n\n      The recent actions by Shasta County “shows the lasting power of these lies,” said Larry Norden, senior director of the elections and government program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. \n  \n\n      “And it’s having real-life consequences in the way we are going to be running our elections this year and next,” he said.\n  \n\n      Officials with Dominion called Shasta’s move “yet another example of how lies about Dominion have damaged our company” but declined further comment on the county’s action.\n  \n\n      The Shasta supervisors who voted to end the contract said they acted because public trust in the Dominion machines had eroded. “You can’t put a price tag on voter trust,” they said in a statement explaining their decision.\n  \n\n      Dominion has argued in the Fox lawsuit that canceled contracts like these, and lost business opportunities going forward, are why it deserves $1.6 billion in damages. Fox News has aggressively pushed back against that figure, claiming Dominion manipulated the underlying data to generate a highly inflated, attention-grabbing number. \n  \n\n      Dominion, which began some two decades ago in the Toronto home of its co-founder and CEO John Poulos, has become one of the biggest suppliers of voting machines and software in the US. \n  \n\n      In 2020, Dominion Voting Systems operated in 28 states – including jurisdictions in key presidential battleground states that Democrat Joe Biden flipped on his way to winning the White House, such as Georgia, Michigan and Arizona.\n  \n\n      Poulos, who has an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, has said he launched the company, in part, because of a desire to help people with disabilities cast ballots without assistance and to improve how paper ballots were marked and counted – after watching the hanging chad debacle in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. (A federal law enacted in 2002 changed some voting procedures in federal elections and required jurisdictions to provide at least one accessible voting system for people with disabilities in each polling place, growing the market for new devices.)\n  \n\n      A New York-based private equity firm, Staple Street Capital, acquired most of Dominion in 2018, and its US headquarters are in Denver. According to court filings in the Fox litigation, Staple Street Capital paid about $38.3 million to buy an approximately 75% stake in Dominion.\n  \n\n      Within days of the 2020 general election, Trump and his top surrogates, including Powell and Giuliani, began spreading unfounded conspiracy theories about Dominion – including claims that its machines had switched votes from Trump to Biden, that it was an instrument of Democratic political figures or that it was a tool of Communist regimes in Latin America.\n  \n\n      Some of the Dominion lies appear to have originated from a Minnesota woman, who emailed Powell, then-Fox host Lou Dobbs and GOP legal activist Tom Fitton hours after news outlets projected Biden’s victory on November 7, 2020. The woman claimed Dominion was a Democratic front that led a multi-state scheme to steal the election, though she said her theories came from “the wind,” which speaks to her, and admitted they were “pretty wackadoodle,” according to court filings.\n  \n\n      In the following days, Powell and Giuliani parroted many of these same unfounded claims about Dominion on Dobbs’ show on Fox Business Channel and other Fox programs. Many of those appearances are at the heart of Dominion’s defamation case against Fox.\n  \n\n      For its part, Fox denies that it defamed Dominion or anyone else, and says its on-air personalities were merely covering newsworthy allegations of election irregularities from public figures, who held prominent roles as top advisers to the sitting president. \n  \n\n      In late 2020, Poulos became more public-facing as he defended the company.\n  \n\n      “Dominion has not and has never been a front for Communists,” he told a Michigan Senate oversight committee in December of that year, as he rattled off an array of fast-spreading conspiracy theories. “Dominion has no ties to the Pelosi family, Feinstein family, Clinton family or George Soros.”\n  \n\n      “The comments about our company being started in Venezuela with Cuban money with the intent to steal elections are beyond bizarre and are complete lies,” he added. “My company started in my basement, which happened to be in Toronto, and our only intention was to help blind people vote on paper ballots.”\n  \n\n      (The GOP-led Senate oversight committee ultimately concluded there was “no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud” in the state’s 2020 election, which Biden won by nearly 3 percentage points.) \n  \n\n      A Dominion spokesman declined to make Poulos available for a CNN interview, citing the upcoming trial in Wilmington, Delaware. It is slated to begin April 17, with jury selection scheduled to start Thursday – barring a last-minute settlement, which is always possible. \n  \n\n      But Poulos has spoken publicly about the high cost for him, his family and employees. All have faced threats, he said.\n  \n\n      In a “60 Minutes” interview last October, Poulos said that the threats had remained so pervasive that his children still were barred from retrieving packages from the front door “until we verify that it`s actually from a trusted sender.”\n  \n\n      He added, “it’s important to all the people whose families have been impacted by this” for those who spread falsehoods about the company to admit they were wrong.\n  \n\n      In court filings last week, Fox asked the judge to block Dominion from bringing up death threats like these at the trial. The network called the threats “horrific and absolutely inexcusable” but argued that they would “arouse the jury’s sympathy” and distract from the legal questions at hand. \n  \n\n      Dominion already has made waves with its defamation lawsuit against the media heavyweight. \n  \n\n      Pre-trial filings have seen the release of incriminating texts and emails that show Fox News’ executives, hosts and producers privately doubted the claims the network was airing publicly about Dominion. \n  \n\n      In one eye-popping message that was disclosed as part of the litigation, Fox News star Tucker Carlson said he “passionately” hates Trump and that Trump’s presidency was a failure. In the November 2020 text exchange, Carlson said, “We’re all pretending we’ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it’s been is too tough to digest. But come on. There isn’t really an upside to Trump.”\n  \n\n      And more revelations may be on the way. Last week, a Delaware judge ruled that Dominion can force Fox Corporation executives Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch to testify in person at the trial.\n  \n\n      Fox’s lawyers contend that pinning any potential damage to Dominion’s business on the network’s coverage ignores other reasons why the company may be facing additional scrutiny from its clients. Fox has highlighted other issues such as internal criticism from Dominion employees, including one who wrote, “Our products suck.” \n  \n\n      During a public meeting earlier this year in Redding, California – nearly 3,000 miles away from the Delaware courtroom where Dominion and Fox News’ legal skirmishes have played out – Patrick Jones, the chairman of the Shasta County Board of Supervisors, quoted claims from Fox News’ legal filings to argue that Dominion’s machines are “riddled with bugs.” The email was sent in October 2020 by Dominion’s director of product strategy and security.\n  \n\n      He joined two other members of the five-person board in the vote to scrap the contract. “People do not trust electronic machines,” Jones said. “We do not trust them, and we have to restore trust.”\n  \n\n      Jones declined an interview request this week, saying CNN “will not tell the truth.” Another Shasta supervisor, Kevin Crye – who says he secured Lindell’s financial support and also backed ending the Dominion contract – did not respond to a CNN inquiry.\n  \n\n      Now, the county, home to roughly 111,000 of the state’s nearly 22 million registered voters, is working to devise a new way of running its elections, ahead of local elections in November. Last week, the board approved spending $950,000 with another vendor to purchase the equipment and software needed to provide accessible voting to disabled residents and to assist with the planned hand count.\n  \n\n      Cathy Darling Allen, the county’s elected clerk and a Democrat, opposed ending the $262,000-a-year contract to lease the Dominion machines. She estimates that hand-counting all ballots in a presidential election will require hiring more than 1,200 temporary workers at a cost of $1.6 million. And she and state officials have warned that a manual tally could come with high error rates.\n  \n\n      “This feels very much like an answer looking for a problem to solve,” Darling Allen told CNN. “We don’t have a problem in Shasta County with elections, and yet here we are.”\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

CNN polling released Monday, which was conducted after the vote to indict him, suggested that it had little effect on views of Trump himself. \n  \n\n      The March poll suggests that just before the indictment, the uptick in views of Biden that had seemed to have been sparked by Democrats outperforming expectations in the 2022 midterms had stalled. The poll finds Biden’s approval rating at 42% overall, with 57% disapproving. In January, 45% approved and 55% disapproved. That shift falls within the poll’s margin of error and is not statistically significant. \n  \n\nCNN Poll: Majority of Americans approve of Trump indictment\n\n\n      On major issues, Biden’s numbers are also stagnant. His approval ratings for handling immigration (35% approve), the economy (37%) and gun policy (37%) all fall significantly below his overall approval rating. On national security (44% approve) and the US relationship with China (40% approve), his numbers are about the same as his overall approval rating. The only issue on which Biden significantly outperforms his overall standing is environmental policy, and even there, most disapprove (46% approve, 52% disapprove).\n  \n\n      The poll also finds negative views of Biden persist across several personal attributes, with majorities saying he does not have the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president (67%), does not inspire confidence (65%), is not honest and trustworthy (54%) and does not care about people like them (54%). Americans are more evenly split over whether Biden can work effectively with Congress – 48% say he can, 51% that he cannot. \n  \n\n      All told, just 32% say that Biden deserves reelection to the presidency, down 5 points since December and about on par with the 33% who said the same about Trump in November 2017. The largest shifts come among younger adults, with just 26% of those younger than 35 saying Biden deserves another term in the new poll, down from 36% in December, and among liberals, shifting from 63% saying he deserved reelection in December to 53% now.\n  \n\n      Generally speaking, the vast majority of people who approve of a president’s performance also say that president deserves reelection, but the new poll suggests an unusually large group of Biden approvers currently say he does not deserve reelection. In September 2019, 3% of all Americans fell into that category for Trump, and just 5% did in March 2010 during Barack Obama’s presidency. For Biden, that number is significantly higher: 11% overall approve of Biden’s handling of the presidency and also say he does not deserve to be reelected.\n  \n\n      This group differs from stronger Biden backers in key ways: Despite their approval of his overall handling of the presidency, majorities in this group have significant doubts about his stamina for the job (70% say he lacks the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president) and ability to inspire confidence (62% say he does not inspire confidence). This “thanks but no thanks” group is also nearly 30 points less likely than others who approve of Biden to say they approve of his handling of the economy.\n  \n\n      Compared with others who approve of Biden, those who fall into this group are also more likely to be political independents (57% identify as independents, compared with 36% who approve and do want him reelected) and younger (64% are younger than 45 compared with 37% of those who approve and do want the president reelected). They are also significantly less likely to be registered voters (60% say they are registered to vote, compared with 86% among those who approve and do want to see Biden reelected), which could mean that they ultimately sit out the presidential election, and in a close race, Biden would need robust turnout among those who approve of his performance. \n  \n\n      Among registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, most (54%) say that they would like to see the Democratic party nominate someone other than Biden in 2024, while 44% say Biden should be the nominee. Despite the stagnation in overall views of the president, that marks an improvement for him. In December, 59% said they would prefer a different candidate, and last summer, that figure stood at 75%. The uptick in support comes largely among college graduates (from 32% wanting Biden to be renominated in December to 45% now) and among independents who lean Democratic (from 22% in December to 36% now).\n  \n\n      As in other recent CNN polling, few who say they’d like to see someone else head the Democratic ticket have a specific replacement candidate in mind. About 7 in 10 in that group say they just generally want to see someone other than Biden, and no individual candidate is named by more than 5% of those looking for an alternate nominee. Those named by more than 1% include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 5%, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 4%, Vice President Kamala Harris and former first lady Michelle Obama at 3% each, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 2% each. \n  \n\n      Democratic-aligned voters split over whether the party would have a better chance of winning in 2024 with Biden at the head of the ticket (49%) or if they’d have a better chance with someone else (49%). Biden’s strongest boosters on this question are Democratic-aligned voters age 65 or older (65% say the party would have a better chance with Biden than someone else), while 61% of those younger than 45 say the party would have a better shot at winning with someone else. \n  \n\nWhy Trump is still favored for the GOP nomination, despite his indictment\n\n\n      The survey also mirrored other national polling conducted before Trump’s indictment in finding an uptick in support for the former president as the GOP nominee (52% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said they thought he ought to be the nominee over another unnamed candidate, up from a low of 38% in December). A sizable share of those seeking a different candidate named Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis when asked if there was someone specific they’d like to see nominated (28% who want to see another candidate lead the ticket named him unprompted). Republican-aligned voters were also split in the pre-indictment poll over whether the party would have a better chance with Trump at the top of the ticket or if someone else would have a better shot at winning. \n  \n\n      The poll found that Republicans and Republican-leaners were more likely to be looking forward to the 2024 election than were Democrats and Democratic-leaners (54% among Republican-aligned Americans, 26% on the Democratic side).\n  \n\n      The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from March 1 through 31 among a random national sample of 1,595 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.\n  \n\n  Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Fox will call these witnesses as part of their defense, but Dominion also wants to question them as part of their case. \n  \n\n      The list includes Fox TV hosts Tucker Carlson, Maria Bartiromo, Sean Hannity, and Bret Baier, as well as Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace.\n  \n\nDominion's historic defamation case against Fox News will go to trial, judge rules, in major decision dismantling key Fox defenses\n\n\n      The filing came amid still-ongoing legal wrangling between the parties about who can be called to testify. There is a hearing slated for Wednesday that will likely address some of these outstanding issues. (For instance, Fox is resisting Dominion’s effort to compel testimony from Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch.)\n  \n\n      The $1.6 billion lawsuit is considered one of the most consequential defamation cases in recent memory. Dominion claims Fox News pushed various pro-Trump conspiracy theories about the election technology company because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.” Fox News has strongly disputed Dominion’s allegations and maintains that it is “proud” of its 2020 election coverage. \n  \n\n      Last week, a Delaware judge ruled that Dominion Voting Systems’ case against Fox News will go to jury trial in mid-April. Both Fox News and Dominion had previously asked the judge to declare them the outright winner without a trial. \n  \n\n      Jury selection is scheduled to begin on April 13.\n  \n\n- CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed to this report \n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

                "content": "\n      As abortion rights become more restricted in the United States, a new study shows that it’s become harder for women to access reproductive health care services more broadly – such as routine screenings and birth control – in recent years.\n  \n\n      Women seeking reproductive health care were more likely to report challenges to access – and more of them – in 2021 than they were in 2017, according to the study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open. Researchers analyzed survey data from thousands of women who were asked to reflect on their experiences with reproductive health care in the three years leading up to the study.\n  \n\n      About 45% of women experienced at least one barrier to reproductive health care services in 2021, up 10% from 2017. Nearly 19% reported at least three barriers in 2021, up from 16% in 2017. \n  \n\nMaternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road   \n\n\n      “Reproductive health care services are among the most common health care needs of women of reproductive age, and access to such care is of paramount public health importance,” the researchers wrote. Delaying or forgoing it can have serious consequences, both to an individual’s physical health and to their general well-being. \n  \n\n      The most commonly cited barrier in both years was finding a physician or clinic that felt comfortable to the patient. About 1 in 4 women identified this as a challenge in 2021, up from about 1 in 5 in 2017. \n  \n\n      Cost became slightly less of a barrier in that timeframe, but interpersonal relationships and logistical challenges such as finding transportation or child care became more challenging. \n  \n\n      The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to these shifts, according to the researchers. Fear of contracting the virus could have heightened anxieties around visiting a health care setting, for example. The child care crisis has been exacerbated in recent years, which could limit travel flexibilities. On the other hand, stimulus checks may have helped ease some financial barriers. \n  \n\n      Broader restrictions on reproductive rights – including a significant cut in federally funded family planning clinics by the Trump administration – probably also played a role, they wrote. \n  \n\n      The largest increases in barriers to reproductive health care were reported by individuals from historically disadvantaged populations, including low-income and Hispanic women. \n  \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n  \n\n      Access to reproductive health care is a “persistent and pressing barrier,” the researchers wrote. “Significant” challenges that existed in 2017 generally got worse in 2021. \n  \n\n      “The study’s findings suggest that efforts are needed to ensure reproductive health care access, especially during disruptive events,” they wrote.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      The Biden administration is facing another lawsuit over extending the pandemic-related pause on federal student loan payments. \n  \n\n      The pause is set to end later this year, but the plaintiffs want the moratorium to end immediately. \n  \n\n      The newest legal challenge was filed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance on behalf of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free market think tank, earlier this week. In a similar lawsuit, private lender SoFi sued the Biden administration last month, also seeking to end the pause on payments. \n  \n\n      The moratorium has been extended eight times under both the Trump and Biden administrations since March 2020, when it was put in place to help people struggling due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n  \n\nBiden's pause on payments has been better for these students than forgiveness\n\n\n      The New Civil Liberties Alliance lawsuit argues that the Department of Education has unlawfully extended the pause, relying on an “ever-shifting foundation of purported legal justifications.”\n  \n\n      The lawsuit alleges that the pause harms nonprofit employers, like the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, that normally use a federal debt relief program for nonprofit workers to help recruit employees. The pause, they argue, reduces the incentive the federal program, known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, provides borrowers to work for a nonprofit.\n  \n\n      Thanks to the pause, most federal student loan borrowers have not been required to make payments for more than three years. Interest has also been frozen during that time.\n  \n\n      The Department of Education has maintained that the pause, as well as a proposed one-time debt cancellation plan, are legal.\n  \n\n      “This lawsuit is an attempt by partisan special interest groups to put millions of borrowers at serious risk of financial harm,” the agency said in a statement sent to CNN. “The Department will continue to fight to deliver relief to borrowers, provide a smooth path to repayment, and protect borrowers from industry and special interests.”\n  \n\nBiden's student loan forgiveness program faces a new threat from Senate Republicans\n\n\n      The latest extension of the pause was put in place by President Joe Biden in November once his separate student loan forgiveness program was also challenged in court. \n  \n\n      The administration has now tied the payment restart date to the litigation over the forgiveness program, which was heard by the US Supreme Court at the end of February.\n  \n\n      Federal student loan payments are set to resume 60 days after the Supreme Court issues its ruling, or in late August – whichever comes first. The justices are expected to rule in late June or early July, but a decision could come earlier. \n  \n\n      If allowed to move forward, Biden’s student loan forgiveness program would cancel up to $20,000 for qualifying low- and middle-income borrowers. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      The remarkable pace with which President Joe Biden has sought to remake the federal bench has been put into jeopardy by dual threats: Democratic Senate absences and a Senate rule that gives Republicans the ability to veto district court nominees for courts in their home states.  \n  \n\n      It’s a combination that has Democrats increasingly concerned about the fate of future nominees at a time when the party had hoped to counteract years judiciary transformation under President Donald Trump.\n  \n\n      They’re now attempting to overcome one of those hurdles by seeking to temporarily replace California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as health issues have sidelined her from the Senate for several weeks, depriving some Biden judicial nominees of the votes they need to overcome GOP opposition on the committee. \n  \n\nMcConnell stares down first big question after return from fall: What to do about Feinstein?\n\n\n      Republicans, at least initially, are skeptical of giving Democrats the cooperation they’ll need to switch Feinstein out for another Democrat on the panel.\n  \n\n      Another blow to the Democratic judiciary overhaul came earlier this month, when Biden’s choice to fill a district court vacancy in Mississippi became the second nominee to be blockaded by the Senate rule known as the blue slip tradition.  \n  \n\n      Mississippi GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith has announced that she would not return her “blue slip” for nominee Scott Colom, effectively sinking his nomination if Democrats choose to continue honoring the rule. The White House has said it is not backing away from its selection of Colom, currently the district attorney for the 16th Judicial District of Mississippi.  \n  \n\n      But even if Democrats wanted to push forward, Feinstein’s absence for several weeks with a case of shingles, stands in the way. Without Feinstein on the panel, the partisan breakdown is 10-10. \n  \n\n      No date has been given for the 89-year-old Feinstein to come back to Washington, and last week, amid pressure to resign, she issued a statement announced she had asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace her on the Judiciary Committee.\n  \n\n      Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin previously acknowledged to CNN that Feinstein’s absence has slowed down their push to confirm nominees. \n  \n\n      “I can’t consider nominees in these circumstances because a tie vote is a losing vote in committee,” Durbin said. \n  \n\n      Asked if her absence has longer ramifications on the Democrats’ ability to confirm nominees, the Senate chairman said “yes, of course it does,” pointing to the long process of getting nominees scheduled for votes during precious floor time. \n  \n\n      “We still have some nominees left on the calendar that we can work on … But we have more in the wings that we would like to process through the committee,” Durbin said. \n  \n\n      Another Democrat who has not been present recently, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman – who is not a member of the Judiciary Committee but whose absence is complicating floor votes on nominees – is slated to return this week.   \n  \n\n      Biden closed out the first years of his presidency having put 97 judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, on the federal bench and the Senate has since confirmed 22 more this year. \n  \n\n      While the president likely won’t match Trump’s successes reshaping the US Supreme Court, his administration has focused on the lower courts. During the Trump years, Senate Republicans confirmed 229 judges, including three justices. The Biden administration has stressed not just the quantity of judges confirmed but also how Biden has sought to bring more professional and demographic diversity to the courts.   \n  \n\n      For Democrats, maintaining – and growing – their control of the Senate in last year’s midterms has made that goal possible. But the new Congress has presented fresh roadblocks in the form of absences, blue slip issues and even skepticism from Democrats about a nominee championed by two members of their own caucus.  \n  \n\n      Even before Hyde-Smith announced her opposition to Colom, court watchers on the left were pressuring Senate Democrats to abandon the blue slip tradition. The rule has not been respected consistently through the modern history of the Senate, and Republicans nixed the requirement for US circuit court vacancies under Trump. Democrats, now in control, have refused to bring it back for appellate nominees, but Durbin has said he’d like to keep it in place for district courts.  \n  \n\n      Durbin didn’t waver on that position when Sen. Ron Johnson flip-flopped last year on his support of a district court nominee in his home state, state Judge William Pocan, effectively torpedoing Pocan’s nomination. A number of other district court vacancies in red states have been filled, with Republicans supporting Biden nominees, including a district court judge for an Indiana vacancy confirmed last month. A Biden nominee for a Louisiana district court has the support of its Republican Senate delegation, Sens. John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy confirmed to CNN.   \n  \n\n      Durbin’s office blasted Hyde-Smith’s opposition to Colom in a statement that did not indicate whether he was rethinking the blue slip rule. “In the coming days, he’ll be assessing and will respond more fully,” said his spokesperson Emily Hampsten.\n  \n\n      Hyde-Smith, when announcing her opposition to Colom, had cited the support a George Soros-linked group had given to his campaign for local district attorney, as well as what she described his “opposition to legislation to protect female athletes.” \n  \n\n      In a letter to the Republican senator obtained by CNN last week, Colom pushed back on those claims. He noted that the Soros contributions were to an independent political action committee and that the committee was not affiliated with his campaign; he denied ever having discussed his policies as district attorney with Soros or the group. \n\n\n      Colom wrote that he was unsure what the senator was referring to in her statement’s allusions to transgender athletes. While he did sign on to a statement opposing the use of law enforcement resources to prosecute doctors that offer gender-affirming care to trans youth, he told the senator that, if confirmed, he’d set his policy views aside and follow the precedents of higher courts.\n  \n\n      White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has called Colom “deeply qualified” and referenced the support he’s received as a district attorney from his constituents, who elected him in 2016 and reelected 2019.  \n  \n\n      “Sen. Hyde-Smith is preventing the people of Mississippi from having a judge in place in a timely fashion to uphold the rule of law for her state,” Jean-Pierre said, declining to weigh in directly on whether the blue slip tradition should be done away with. \n  \n\n      “I’ll leave it to Congress … to figure that piece out,” Jean-Pierre said.  \n  \n\n      But as the Biden judicial push digs deeper into states where one or both of the senators are Republican, the blue slip debate will be harder to avoid.\n  \n\n      “It was designed for senators to touch base with their local bar and judges and others because they have their ear to the ground and they are qualified to do a personal gut check, but to simply say I will not return a blue slip on someone because of  x or y views is deeply abhorrent to the spirit of the blue slip process,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN after Hyde-Smith announced her opposition to Colom.  \n  \n\n      Another fight may be brewing. Going into the current congressional recess, neither of Kansas’ Republican senators had committed to supporting a Biden nominee for a judicial nominee for that state’s district court.  \n  \n\n      Sen. Jerry Moran told CNN that he was in “conversation with the White House about judges,” and Sen. Roger Marshall said he was waiting a rating from the American Bar Association on the nominee, Jabari Wamble. (Wamble did not received an ABA rating when he previously was put forward for an appellate opening last Congress, for which he was not confirmed; a spokesperson for the ABA told CNN that it does not comment about ongoing judicial reviews.)  \n  \n\n      Blue slip skeptics say that the practice is preventing Biden from even choosing nominees if the White House cannot reach a deal with Republican home states senators on someone they’ll support. \n  \n\n      “If it’s a blue slip problem and the Republicans aren’t turning in their blue slips and they’re being obstructionist, then we need to think about changing the rules, said Democratic Sen.

John Cornyn, whose state has four district court vacancies.  “We’re standing ready to help in any way we can, but they are so slow.”  \n  \n\n      Since Feinstein’s absence was announced, the committee has only approved one nominee, judge Matthew Brookman, the GOP-supported appointee for the Indiana district court seat. \n  \n\n      Ten nominees for Article III judgeships have been eligible since mid-March for a final committee vote that, if successful, would advance them to the Senate floor.

Not every Democrat on the committee has committed to supporting him, with Hirono telling CNN earlier this month she was still undecided last week.\n  \n\n      Delaney is among the nominees whose committee vote has been delayed while Feinstein has been absent from the Senate, but it is not clear that even if she returned the votes would be there to advance him. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n\n  CNN’s Manu Raju contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\n  \n\n      Fox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\n  \n\n      Here’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 8, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.\n  \n\n      “That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. They were founded as a company to fix elections, they have a terrible record, and they are extremely hackable,” Giuliani said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 13, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Let’s start with Dominion, a straight out disavowal of any claim of fraud against the company, its software or machines. Your reaction,” Dobbs asked.\n  \n\nWhat to know ahead of the Fox News and Dominion trial\n\n\n      “Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.\n  \n\n      “We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.\n  \n\n      “Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”\n  \n\nThe broadcast: Quote-tweet by Dobbs of Giuliani tweet on November 14, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Did you know a foreign company, DOMINION, was counting our vote in Michigan, Arizona and Georgia and other states,” Giuliani wrote.\n  \n\n      “Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 14, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “It was created for the express purpose of being able to alter votes and secure the reelection of Hugo Chavez and then Maduro. They’ve used it in Argentina,” Powell said. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.”\n  \n\n      “Yes. And hopefully the Department of Justice, but who knows anymore,” Pirro said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Fox & Friends Sunday” on November 15, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Sidney Powell is also talking about potential kickbacks that government officials, who were asked to use Dominion, actually also enjoyed benefits to their families,” Bartiromo said. “We’re going to talk about that coming up as well.”\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 15, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed. It was designed to rig elections … We have so much evidence, I feel like it’s coming in through a fire hose,” Powell said.\n  \n\n      “Wow,” Bartiromo said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 16, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said.\n  \n\n      “Sure,” Dobbs said.\n  \n\n      Powell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’”\n  \n\n      Powell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 18, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.\n  \n\n      “It’s outrageous,” Dobbs said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 19, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Let me put it this way, there are thousands of people in federal prisons on far less evidence of criminal conduct than we have already against the Smartmatic and Dominion Systems companies,” Powell said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 21, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 24, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said.\n  \n\n      “I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 30, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, kickbacks.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Different states shaved different amounts of votes, or the system was set up to shave and flip different votes in different states,” Powell said. “Some people were targeted as individual candidates. It’s really the most massive and historical egregious fraud the world has ever seen.”\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Hannity” on November 30, 2020.\n  \n\nTucker Carlson, Sean Hannity among prominent Fox hosts, execs set to take stand at defamation trial \n\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “The machine ran an algorithm that shaved votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden,” Powell said. “They used the machines to trash large batches of votes that should have been awarded to President Trump. And they used a machine to inject and add massive quantities of votes for Mr. Biden.”\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on December 4, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Dominion Voting Systems, you have described it with algorithms which were designed to be inaccurate rather than to be a secure system,” Dobbs said. \n  \n\n      “Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: Dobbs tweet with embedded document on December 10, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “The 2020 Election is a cyber Pearl Harbor,” Dobbs wrote, embedding a document.\n  \n\n      “We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on December 10, 2020.\n  \n\nFox News reaches settlement with Venezuelan businessman in election defamation case\n\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Let me make you an offer, very straightforwardly,” Dobbs said. “We will gladly put forward your evidence that supports your claim that this was a Cyber Pearl Harbor. We have tremendous evidence already … of fraud in this election, but I will be glad to put forward on this broadcast whatever evidence you have, and we’ll be glad to do it immediately.”\n  \n\nThe broadcast: Dobbs tweet with embedded video of Powell interview on December 10, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Cyber Pearl Harbor: @SidneyPowell1 reveals groundbreaking new evidence indicating our Presidential election came under massive cyber-attack orchestrated with the help of Dominion, Smartmatic, and foreign adversaries. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Fox & Friends” with hosts Will Cain, Pete Hegseth and Rachel Campos-Duffy on December 12, 2020.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “We have a machine, the Dominion machine, that’s as filled with holes as Swiss cheese and was developed to steal elections, and being used in the states that are involved,” Giuliani said.\n  \n\nThe broadcast: “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on January 26, 2021.\n  \n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud.\n  \n\nKey false quote: “Every outlet in the country, they go, ‘Mike Lindell, there’s no evidence, and he’s making fraudulent statements.’ No. I have the evidence. I dare people to put it on. I dare Dominion to sue me because then it will get out faster. So, this is – you know, they don’t – they don’t want to talk about it,” Lindell said.\n  \n\n      “No, they don’t,” Carlson said.\n  \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Things happen… this is not unusual… This does not seem unusual to me.”\n  \n\n      The Monday morning hearing was only about four minutes long, and there was no mention of potential settlement talks.\n  \n\n      The high-stakes defamation trial against Fox News, initially set to begin with opening statements on Monday, was abruptly delayed on Sunday evening, in an eleventh-hour twist.\n  \n\n      Speculation around a potential out-of-court settlement has reached a fever pitch because of the delay and comes after the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday night that Fox was pushing for a last-second deal to avoid trial. The newspaper is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, whose media empire includes Fox News. If the trial happens as planned, Dominion has the power to force Murdoch to testify in-person.\n  \n\n      The proceedings are scheduled to reconvene Tuesday at 9 a.m. in Wilmington, Delaware.\n  \n\n      The historic defamation lawsuit brought against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems could have significant ramifications for the right-wing cable channel.\n  \n\n      Dominion, an election technology company, sued Fox News in 2021 over the network’s repeated promotion of false claims about the company, including that its voting machines rigged the 2020 election by flipping millions of ballots from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.\n  \n\nWhat to know about the Fox News and Dominion trial\n\n\n      The company alleges that people at Fox News acted with actual malice and “recklessly disregarded the truth” when they spread this disinformation about Dominion. To prove “actual malice,” Dominion must convince a jury that people at Fox News who were responsible for these broadcasts knew the Dominion claims were false or recklessly disregarded evidence of falsity – but put them on-air anyway.\n  \n\n      Dominion will now need to convince the jury that Fox acted with “actual malice” — showing the right-wing network’s hosts and executives knew what was being said on-air was false but broadcast it anyway, or acted with such a reckless disregard for the truth that they should be held liable.\n  \n\n      Dominion will no longer try to prove that it lost $600 million in contracts and profits because of Fox News’ election lies – but the company is still seeking $1.6 billion in overall damages and is adjusting how it will pursue that eye-popping payout at trial. \n  \n\n      Earlier on Monday, Fox News publicly asserted that Dominion had reduced its damages claims, down to roughly $1 billion, citing an email that Dominion sent Friday to Fox’s lawyers. But the voting technology company said in a statement Monday that the topline number hasn’t changed. \n  \n\n       But what has apparently changed is how Dominion will try to win those damages with the jury, by focusing on the claimed reputational losses that tanked the company’s value.\n  \n\n      Fox has aggressively pushed back on the $1.6 billion figure, which it says is massively inflated. Fox lawyers have argued that Dominion can’t prove the lost contracts that it is claiming.\n  \n\n       “There’s also a problem that a huge chunk of their lost profits is coming from business they haven’t actually lost,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said during a hearing last month. \n  \n\n      Fox has said it didn’t defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. A spokesperson for Fox has said the network “is proud of our 2020 election coverage” and that its coverage “stands in the highest tradition of American journalism.” The company also said “Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights.” \n  \n\n      Fox has also accused Dominion of generating “noise and confusion” around the case, stating, “the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution,” specifically the First Amendment.\n  \n\n      The judge said Monday that he appreciates Fox’s recent apology for providing him with inaccurate information about Murdoch’s role at the network, and will decide later if any punishment is necessary.\n  \n\n      Davis — who last week said he would bring in a special master to investigate if Fox intentionally lied to the court about Murdoch — said in a letter that he considers the matter “to be closed.” \n  \n\n      “I appreciate the detailed explanation and the apology,” Davis wrote in a letter to Fox’s attorneys. “As it concerns the Court, I consider the disclosure matter regarding officers of Fox News Network, LLC and/or Rupert Murdoch to be closed. With regards to any prejudice suffered by Dominion, I will address that later, if necessary.”\n  \n\n      Fox apologized to Davis in a letter on Friday, days after he lashed out at the network’s attorneys for repeatedly providing incomplete and inaccurate information about Murdoch’s dual roles at Fox News and its parent corporation. \n  \n\n      The network’s lawyers say the spat was a “misunderstanding” and wasn’t an intentional attempt to deceive the judge or hide evidence from Dominion.\n  \n\nCNN’s Jon Passantino, Ramishah Maruf, and Catherine Thorbecke contributed\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Davis said Thursday afternoon that he made good progress, and that there were “more than enough jurors” to start the trial as planned on Monday, when opening statements are expected.\n  \n\n      Jury selection is done for the week, and there are no in-court proceedings scheduled for Friday.\n  \n\n      Roughly 300 potential jurors were summoned to the Delaware Superior Court and will eventually be whittled down to a panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. The high-stakes trial — which will put a spotlight on Fox’s 2020 election denialism and the role of disinformation in American politics — is expected to last about six weeks.\n  \n\n      Potential jurors were peppered with questions about their news consumption habits, including whether they watch Fox News. But Judge Davis narrowed the scope of the questioning — he didn’t want jurors to be asked if they believe the 2020 election was legitimate, or if they had any connection to the January 6 insurrection.\n  \n\nFox News reaches settlement with Venezuelan businessman in election defamation case\n\n\n      The case revolves around Fox’s decision, after Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, to allow haywire conspiracy theories about Dominion onto its airwaves. The allegations, levied by Fox guests and embraced by some Fox hosts, falsely claimed Dominion and its voting software flipped millions of ballots away from Trump, to steal the election.\n  \n\n      Dominion has argued that Fox destroyed its reputation as a trusted voting technology company by repeatedly amplifying these false claims. Emails and texts unearthed during the litigation have shown that many Fox hosts, producers, and top executives privately believed the claims on their airwaves were preposterous and untrue.\n  \n\n      In recent weeks, Dominion’s case has picked up steam, though it’s still a high bar to prove defamation. The company will need to convince the jury that people at Fox acted with “actual malice” — they knew what was being said on-air was false but broadcast it anyway, or they acted with such a reckless disregard for the truth that they should be held liable.\n  \n\n      The judge has already rejected several First Amendment defenses that Fox hoped to invoke, and he further constrained Fox in a flurry of pretrial rulings this week, stopping the right-wing network from trying to argue that the allegedly defamatory statements were “newsworthy” and thus deserved coverage.\n  \n\nDominion can force Murdochs to testify at Fox News defamation trial, judge says\n\n\n      An in an 11th-hour twist, the judge sanctioned Fox on Wednesday for withholding evidence from Dominion, and said he’d assign an outside attorney to investigate whether Fox misled the court and deliberately hid any additional material from Dominion.\n  \n\n      Fox News says it didn’t defame Dominion and maintains that it is still “proud” of its 2020 election coverage. The right-wing network also denied that it withheld any evidence from Dominion.\n  \n\n      “Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights,” a Fox spokesperson said in a statement. “While Dominion has pushed irrelevant and misleading information to generate headlines, Fox News remains steadfast in protecting the rights of a free press, given a verdict for Dominion and its private equity owners would have grave consequences for the entire journalism profession.”\n  \n\n— CNN’s Danny Freeman contributed to this article.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

                "content": "\n      The cross, and the empty tomb.\n  \n\n      Both Christian symbols are bookends to the Easter story. One symbolizes the tragic execution of Jesus while the other represents the Christian belief in his resurrection, and the claim that death does not have the final word on him or his followers. \n  \n\n      As millions of Americans celebrate the holiest day in the Christian calendar on Sunday, most will hear some variation of this Easter message — finding new life in unforeseen places.\n  \n\n      But that message could also describe a surprising prediction about the future of Christianity in the US.\n  \n\n      For years, church leaders and commentators have warned that Christianity is dying in America. They say the American church is poised to follow the path of churches in Western Europe: soaring Gothic cathedrals with empty pews, shuttered church buildings converted into skate parts and nightclubs, and a secularized society where one theologian said Christianity as a norm is “probably gone for good — or at least for the next 100 years.”\n  \n\n      Yet when CNN asked some of the nation’s top religion scholars and historians recently about the future of Christianity in the US, they had a different message. \n  \n\n      They said the American church is poised to find new life for one major reason: Waves of Christians are migrating to the US. \n  \n\n      And they said the biggest challenge to Christianity’s future in America is not declining numbers, but the church’s ability to adapt to this migration.\n  \n\nJoseph P. Slaughter, a historian and assistant professor of religion at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, says people have been predicting the extinction of Christianity in the US for over two centuries, and it hasn’t happened yet.\n  \n\n      He pointed to Thomas Jefferson, one of the nation’s founding fathers, who predicted in the 1820s that Christianity would be replaced in the US by a more enlightened form of religion that rejected Jesus’ divinity and belief in miracles.\n  \n\n      Instead, Jefferson’s prophecy was followed by a series of revivals, including the Second Great Awakening, which swept across America and reasserted Christianity as a dominant force in American life.\n  \n\n      “I’d never bet against American Christianity — particularly evangelicalism,” Slaughter says, “and its ability to adapt and remain a significant shaper of the American society.” \n  \n\n      If one only looks at the numbers, Slaughter’s optimism seems misguided. Virtually every recent poll about Christianity in America has been brutal for its followers. \n  \n\n      About 64% of Americans call themselves Christian today. That might sound like a lot, but 50 years ago that number was 90%, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. That same survey said the Christian majority in the US may disappear by 2070.\n  \n\n      The Covid-19 pandemic also hurt the church in America. Church attendance has rebounded recently but remains slightly below pre-pandemic levels.  A  2021 Gallup poll revealed another grim number for Christians: church membership in the US has fallen below 50% for the first time. \n  \n\n      In addition, a cascade of headlines in recent years have stained the church’s reputation, including sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention; the spread of White Christian nationalism; and the perception that the church oppresses marginalized groups such as LGBTQ people.\n  \n\n      Church leaders in the US also have fretted about the rise of “nones.” These are people who describe themselves as atheists, agnostics or “nothing in particular” when asked their religious identity.\n  \n\n      The ascent of nones will transform the country’s religious and political landscape, says Tina Wray, a professor of religious and theological studies at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. About 30% of Americans now call themselves nones.\n  \n\n      “The interest of the nones will soon outweigh those of the religious right in just a matter of years,” Wray says. “Nones are going to vote as a bloc and they’re going to be pretty powerful. White evangelicals will eventually be eclipsed by the unaffiliated.” \n  \n\n      Wray says those who are optimistic about the future of the American church underestimate how quickly Christianity can lose its influence even in a place where it once thrived. She cites what’s happened in the Republic of Ireland, an overwhelmingly Catholic country.\n  \n\n      The Catholic Church prohibits divorce and was once so powerful in Ireland that the country wouldn’t legally grant its citizens the legal right to a divorce until 1995, says Wray, author of “What the Bible Really Tells Us: The Essential Guide to Biblical Literacy.” But Wray adds that she recently traveled to Ireland and discovered many of its citizens have left the religion. Churches are being closed and turned into apartment buildings, she says.\n  \n\n      “People who went to mass everyday stopped going,” she says. “There’s this cultural Catholic identity, but as far as practicing their faith, it’s just disappearing. So within a generation, that’s all it took. It’s just shocking.”\n  \n\n      Most of the religious scholars CNN spoke to said the American church may find salvation in another demographic trend: the booming of Christianity in what is called the “Global South,” the regions encompassing Latin America, Africa and Asia.\n  \n\n      The world’s largest megachurch, for example, is not in the US. It’s in South Korea. The Yoido Full Gospel Church has a weekly attendance of about 600,000 members. \n  \n\n      Perry Hamalis spent time as a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, where he personally witnessed the vitality of the Christian church in the Global South.\n  \n\n      He says the church is not perceived in South Korea as an instrument of oppression, but one of liberation. When South Korea was colonized by the Japanese in the early 20th century, the church aligned with Koreans to protest.\n  \n\n      “Christianity was looked at not as a religion of empire and of the colonizers, but as the religion of the anti-colonial movement and of pro-democracy,” says Hamalis, a religion professor at North Central College in Illinois.\n  \n\n      The US has more immigrants than any other country. People from Latin America and Asia now make up the overwhelming majority of immigrants to the US, and many are bringing their religious fervor with them.\n  \n\n      This migration is known as the “Browning of America,” a phrase describing a demographic shift that is expected to make White people the minority in the US by 2045. \n  \n\n      Those who predict that the church in America will collapse often overlook how the migration of Global South Christians to America will revitalize the country’s religious landscape, scholars say. Christianity could rebound in America if White Christians embrace this one change, they say.\n  \n\n      Tish Harrison Warren, a New York Times columnist, pointed out recently that Latino evangelicals are now the fastest-growing group of evangelicals in the US.\n  \n\n      “We cannot assume that America will become more secular so long as the future of America is less white,” Warren wrote.\n  \n\n      The influx of Black and brown Christians from places like Latin America and Asia collides with another trend: a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement that insists, incorrectly, that the US was founded as a White, Christian nation. It is hostile to non-White immigrants.\n  \n\n      Some churches may discover that Jesus’ command to welcome the stranger collides with their definition of patriotism, Hamalis says.\n  \n\n      “Many congregations don’t realize how much of their Christian identity is wrapped up with a kind of (Christian) nationalist narrative,” Hamalis says. “There’s nothing wrong with loving one’s country, but from a Christian perspective that ought to always be secondary to the mission of building the body of Christ and witnessing to the Gospel in the world.”\n  \n\n      There are other factors hiding in plain sight that point to the continued vitality of Christianity, others say.\n  \n\n      For one, declining church membership doesn’t automatically translate into declining influence.\n  \n\n      Consider some recent landmark events. White evangelicals played a critical role in getting former President Trump elected. Conservative Christian groups played a crucial role in the recent passage of state laws limiting LGBTQ rights. And the Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe vs. Wade was a massive victory for many conservative Christians.\n  \n\n      And atheism remains a taboo in American politics. American voters still prefer candidates – including presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden – who profess or evoke Christian beliefs.\n  \n\n      “Christianity still holds a lot of capital in this country,” says Lee M. Jefferson, an associate professor of religion at Centre College in Kentucky.\n  \n\n      “There has always been a popular notion that a religious community’s strength or influence is connected to numbers and attendance,” Jefferson says. “Even if there is ample space in cathedrals, Christianity will still hold some strong relevance in different landscapes in the US.”\n  \n\n      Even the rise of the “nones,” the growing number of Americans who say they don’t care about religion, is not as much of a threat to the church as initial reports suggest, scholars say.\n  \n\n      A growing number of Americans may no longer identify as Christian, but many still care about spirituality, says Hans Gustafson, author of “Everyday Wisdom: Interreligious Studies for a Pluralistic World.” \n  \n\n      “Just because more Americans are disaffiliating with institutionalized religion — most notably Christian traditions — this does not always mean that people are becoming less religious,” says Gustafson, director of the Jay Phillips Center for Interreligious Studies at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.\n  \n\n      “Many still practice spirituality: prayer, meditation… and sometimes even regularly attend religious houses of worship,” he says.\n  \n\n      Among Americans with no religious affiliation, some still pray daily and say religion is very important in their lives, Gustafson says.\n  \n\n      He cites a surprising finding from a 2018 Pew Research Center study of religion in Western Europe. The study found that nones in the US are “much more likely” to pray and believe in God than their European counterparts, said Neha Sahgal, a vice president of research at Pew.\n  \n\n      “In fact, by some of these standard measures of religious commitment, American ‘nones’ are as religious as — or even more religious than — Christians in several European countries, including France, Germany and the UK,” Sahgal wrote.\n  \n\n      Despite the optimism of many religious scholars, the future of Christianity in America still seems uncertain. Poll numbers about the decline of religiousness in the US cannot be ignored, along with something more intangible: the frailties of human nature.\n  \n\n      What if the US enters another xenophobic period and limits migration from non-White Christians? \n  \n\n      What if progressive Christians prove unwilling to align with non-White immigrants who tend to be more conservative on issues of sexuality and gender? \n  \n\n      And what if some Christians still cling to the belief that America is supposed to be a White Christian nation, even if that assumption causes them to close their church doors to non-White immigrants who could be their salvation?\n  \n\n      If that happens, an Easter morning symbol in American churches won’t just be an empty tomb, but empty pews.\n  \n\n      But Hamalis, the religion professor who saw Christianity boom in South Korea, says Christians who fear that kind of future can take solace in the Easter message.\n  \n\n      “From a Christian perspective, there’s nothing to fear because even death has been conquered,” Hamalis says. “When we are liberated from that fear, we can embrace the person who’s different from us, who speaks a different language or comes from a different culture. We can put ourselves out there in a way that we can’t if we’re just afraid.”\n  \n\n      He and other scholars envision a vibrant future for Christianity in the US that’s shared by Warren, the New York Times columnist:\n  \n\n      “The future of American Christianity is neither white evangelicalism nor white progressivism,” Warren wrote. “The future of American Christianity now appears to be a multiethnic community that is largely led by immigrants of the children of immigrants.”\n  \n\n      If the American church can embrace this future and reverse its shrinking membership, it will have experienced its own resurrection. \n  \n\nJohn Blake is a Senior Writer at CNN and the author of “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n      I teach African American history at Simmons College of Kentucky, a historically Black college (HBCU) in Louisville. This week, we’ve been studying the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the Jim Crow period of US history. \n  \n\n      In the late 19th century, White, Southern Democrats (then the party of White supremacy and segregation) dubbed themselves the “Redeemers,” a group whose goal was to “save” the South from Northern carpetbaggers and newly freed Black people. \n  \n\n      The so-called Redeemers took over state legislatures with the primary goals of disenfranchising Black voters, barring Black people from holding political office, and establishing a politics that would render the White power structure impervious to disruption. \n  \n\n      When Republicans in the Tennessee House of Representatives voted this week to expel two Black members — Justin Jones and Justin Pearson — they revealed their resemblance to the anti-democratic, authoritarian Redeemers of more than a century ago.\n  \n\n      In 1868, White legislators in Georgia voted to expel the 33 Black men elected to state government. \n  \n\n      Henry McNeal Turner, a well-known leader in the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) denomination, was one of the men expelled from his position by the Georgia politicians. \n  \n\n      In remarks during the proceedings, he stated, “[White legislators] question my right to a seat in this body, to represent the people whose legal votes elected me. This objection, sir, is an unheard of monopoly of power. No analogy can be found for it, except it be the case of a man who should go into my house, take possession of my wife and children and then tell me to walk out.” \n  \n\nOpinion: The fight against 'woke' is really conservative gaslighting\n\n\n      Even though the Black lawmakers were soon reinstated, the actions of the White lawmakers in Georgia were just a foretaste of the political machinations to come. \n  \n\n      In 1890, the state of Mississippi called for a new convention to rewrite the state’s constitution. It had already adopted a new and relatively progressive constitution after the Civil War, but with the onset of Redemption, White lawmakers took control of the state government and began dismantling the rights Black people had only recently gained. \n  \n\n      In the newer version of the constitution that was later ratified, White Mississippi lawmakers installed measures to prevent Black people from voting. But because of the Reconstruction amendments to the US Constitution that guaranteed equal protection under the law and the right of Black men to vote, White Redeemers had to find new ways to repress Black people without making laws explicitly about race.  \n  \n\n      So they used policies such as the poll tax, which most Black people could not afford to pay. They instituted the “understanding clause” — a selectively applied measure where potential voters had to interpret a passage from the state constitution to the satisfaction of a White registrar. \n  \n\n      The “grandfather clause” stipulated that a person’s grandfather had to be eligible to vote in order for their descendants to exercise the franchise. Of course, this excluded most Black people whose grandparents had been enslaved and thus, ineligible to vote. \n  \n\n      By the early 1900s, nearly all the former Confederate states had followed Mississippi’s example. \n  \n\n      In class, my students listened with stunned incredulity as they learned about the cruel and ruthless politics of the Redeemers. Unfortunately, the historical parallels to present-day events are too obvious to ignore. \n  \n\n      The actions of Republicans in the Tennessee legislature resemble the attempts of White Southern Redeemers to take back the South at the end of the 19th century. \n  \n\n      These new Redeemers are using their power as a tool of intimidation. What other conclusion can be drawn from the inappropriate and disproportionate response to a decorum infraction? \n  \n\nOpinion: As GOP governors obscure Black history, let's finally tell the truth about Marcus Garvey\n\n\n      Expulsion is the most severe consequence the legislature can enact against another member of that body. Since the Civil War, only three other members of the Tennessee state legislature have been expelled — and for much more serious offenses. \n  \n\n      The new Redeemers are not confined to one state, either. \n  \n\n      Attempts to strip local officials in the city of Jackson — where more than 80% of the population is Black — of their authority to monitor the city’s water system, police force and courts are underway in Mississippi. \n  \n\n      In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Stop WOKE Act” into law, which was intended to prevent teachings or mandatory workplace activities that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed based necessarily on their race, color, sex or national origin. “In Florida, we will not let the far-left woke agenda take over our schools and workplaces. There is no place for indoctrination or discrimination in Florida,” DeSantis said.\n  \n\n      And, of course, the attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021 by supporters of former President Donald Trump was the most egregious example of how far right-wing factions are willing to go to subvert the political process. \n  \n\n      The era of Redemption cemented decades of Jim Crow segregation. More than 4,000 “racial terror” lynchings occurred throughout that period, the Equal Justice Initiative has documented.\n  \n\n      Substantial change only came with the onset of the Civil Rights movement. Years of nonviolent direct action protest, constant lobbying in state and political governments and the martyrdom of many activists including Martin Luther King, Jr., finally interrupted traditions of segregation and White supremacy. \n  \n\n      It could be that a similar movement is necessary to disempower the Redeemers of today. \n  \n\n      When all the standard means of change — namely the democratic process itself — have been co-opted and subverted by authoritarians, then the people are only left with protest. \n  \n\nOpinion: The Clarence Thomas revelations are the last straw. It's time for Congress to act\n\n\n      If the goal of the Tennessee GOP was to intimidate people into acquiescence with their expulsion of Pearson and Jones, their tactic backfired in a spectacular way. \n  \n\n      Far from instilling fear, their expulsions and their stirring words in response have raised them to national prominence. \n  \n\n      Instead of dissuading Tennesseans from their calls for gun control, Republican legislators seem to have energized the people and motivated them to resist even more vigorously. \n  \n\n      With the rise of social media and other digital forms of information sharing, movements can be mobilized in moments. \n  \n\n      Although there were constant attempts throughout the years, it took decades for people to mount the resistance necessary to topple Jim Crow. In today’s environment, action might occur more swiftly. \n  \n\n      Those words, redemption and redeemer, are significant. \n  \n\n      This is Holy Week in the Christian religion. Events such as Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday culminate in the observance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday. These liturgies commemorate the redemption — Jesus paying the price for humanity’s sin. \n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      In many Christian traditions, redemption is a sacred theological principle that undergirds the hope of salvation. It is likely that many of the Tennessee Republican lawmakers will attend church this Sunday to celebrate the redemption that Easter heralds. \n  \n\n      Easter provides the perfect opportunity for these lawmakers to ponder the true meaning of redemption and which redeemer they are following.  \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n      Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott announced this weekend that he plans to pardon a defendant convicted last week in the shooting death of a US military veteran who took part in a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest. \n  \n\n      Abbott’s planned pardon is a dangerous attack on the rule of law.\n  \n\n      Why is the Republican governor – who pardoned just two people last year – in a hurry to pardon the person who was convicted days ago of fatally shooting 28-year-old Air Force veteran Garrett Foster in the middle of a Texas street? \n  \n\n      Abbott’s pardon announcement came after he was goaded to do so by figures on the right – from Fox News host Tucker Carlson to the chairman of the Texas Republican Party to Kyle Rittenhouse. The last became celebrated in right-wing circles when, as a teenager, he shot three people in 2020 – killing two and injuring another – during unrest and anti-racism protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin. (Rittenhouse, who was acquitted on all counts in November 2021, testified that he acted in self-defense.)\n  \n\n      The facts of the Texas murder case were fairly straightforward: On the night of July 25, 2020, defendant Daniel Perry was working as an Uber driver in Austin as protests were taking place in the Texas capital over the gruesome murder of George Floyd. Foster, who was openly carrying an AK-47, was one of the protesters taking part in the demonstrations. \n  \n\nTexas Gov. Abbott says he's working to pardon sergeant convicted of killing protester at 2020 BLM rally\n\n\n      According to Austin police, Perry was driving his car when he reached an intersection blocked by BLM protesters. He initially paused for a few seconds to allow some demonstrators to cross the street, but after honking his horn at them, he ran a red light. The prosecution argued Perry initiated the encounter by running the light and turning into the crowd, according to CNN affiliate KEYE. That’s when the confrontation took place between Perry and Foster – both White and legally armed.  \n  \n\n      There are conflicting accounts as to whether Foster pointed his weapon at Perry or Perry made the first move. What’s undisputed, however, is that Perry fired five shots from his .357 revolver through his car window, killing Foster. Perry fled the scene but later called police to report the shooting, saying he acted in self-defense.\n\n\n      During the trial, the key question for the Texas jury was whether Perry’s shooting was justified under the state’s “Stand Your Ground” law, which allows deadly force to be used by those who feel their life is in danger. \n  \n\n      Prosecutors argued Perry had instigated the incident and introduced into evidence messages that suggested the shooting was not a spur-of-the-moment act but a premeditated one. One of the most damning was Perry’s Facebook message to a friend before the shooting that he might “kill a few people on my way to work. They are rioting outside my apartment complex.” Defense attorneys said that Foster had threatened Perry by pointing his gun at Perry.\n  \n\nOpinion: Idaho's new abortion law is first to challenge the right to travel\n\n\n      During the eight-day trial, dozens of witnesses testified, and forensic evidence was presented. After deliberating for 17 hours, the jury rendered a unanimous verdict on Friday finding Perry guilty of murder. (The jury found him not guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and a deadly conduct charge is pending with the county attorney’s office.)\n  \n\n      Then Carlson and others on the right began to pressure Abbott to issue a pardon, because they didn’t agree with the verdict. \n  \n\n      On his Fox News show on Friday night, Carlson called on Abbott to pardon Perry, arguing that the defendant had acted in self-defense – despite the jury rejecting that argument. Carlson even attacked the prosecutor by describing him as a “Soros-funded DA,” invoking the billionaire Jewish philanthropist whose name is often used as an antisemitic putdown by the right. Carlson declared that the verdict “means that in the state of Texas, if you have the wrong politics, you’re not allowed to defend yourself.”\n  \n\n      The Fox News host was not alone in clamoring for Perry to be pardoned for killing a protester advocating for Black Lives Matter, an organization that has been repeatedly demonized by the right, with then-President Donald Trump in 2020 calling the words “a symbol of hate” and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in 2021 labeling the movement “the strongest terrorist threat” in the country.\n  \n\n      Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released a statement to Fox News Digital claiming that “the Soros-backed DA … cares more about the radical agenda of dangerous Antifa and BLM mobs than justice.” And another Texas Republican, US Rep. Ronny Jackson, tweeted his demand that Abbott “PARDON Daniel Perry IMMEDIATELY!”  \n  \n\nOpinion: Three little letters that have Florida's Ron DeSantis on the attack\n\n\n      Did Jackson cite evidence showing that the jury had made a mistake? Nope. But like some other Republicans, he dog-whistled the name Soros, saying, “don’t let a Soros-owned Austin liberal DA destroy our justice system.”\n  \n\n      As the pressure campaign mounted,  Abbott announced that he would ask the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles – whose members he appoints – to expedite the pardon paperwork for Perry, which he vowed to sign as soon as it “hits my  desk.” The governor justified his work for a pardon by saying, “Texas has one of the strongest ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney.”\n  \n\n      But the jury was aware of the Stand Your Ground law. It reviewed the facts in the case and determined that Perry was guilty. If the verdict is so clearly wrong, then lawyers for the defendant should file an appeal. (Perry’s attorney, Clint Broden, told CNN his client plans to appeal the verdict.)\n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      In fact, David Wahlberg, a former Travis County criminal court judge, told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper that he can’t think of another case in Texas history when a governor sought a pardon before a verdict was formally appealed.\n  \n\n      Trial verdicts are determined by judges and juries, and sentences should not be set aside by a governor – apparently for political reasons. What Abbott is doing is not just wrong, it’s dangerous. His pardon, when it comes, is not what the rule of law looks like.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "content": "\n      Across the United States, more than 150 million people are being faced with the possibility of a new reality: life without TikTok.\n  \n\n      The wildly popular short-form video app has been at the center of an ongoing battle, with lawmakers calling for an outright ban, and the company portraying itself as a critical community space, educational platform and just plain fun. \n  \n\n      In Hong Kong, there’s no need to imagine that reality: TikTok discontinued its services there in 2020.\n  \n\nIndia bans TikTok as tensions with China escalate \n\n\n      Its abrupt departure was met with mixed reactions: disappointment from some users and content creators, but also relief from others who say life is better without the app’s infinite scroll.\n  \n\n      At the time of its exit, TikTok had a relatively modest presence in the city and was not ubiquitous like it is in the US today.\n  \n\n      But the varied reactions to its departure, and the way users have pivoted to other platforms or even real-life offline communities, offer Americans a glimpse into their potential TikTok-less future.\n  \n\n      TikTok announced its exit from Hong Kong in July 2020, a week after China imposed a controversial national security law in the city. The decision came as the app tried to distance itself from China and its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, in the face of growing pressure in the US under the Trump administration.\n  \n\n      But it meant a jarring halt for creators like Shivani Dukhande, who had roughly 45,000 followers at the time the app left Hong Kong.\n  \n\n      Dukhande, 25, saw her account take off in early 2020 during the pandemic, with lifestyle content such as cooking and wellness videos flourishing on the platform.\n  \n\n      “There were a lot of new creators emerging,” she said. “We used to all collaborate together, we had a [group] chat where we would all speak and share ideas and it created a community.”\n  \n\n      Momentum began to build. Companies started reaching out to Dukhande, paying for sponsored content and collaborating on ad campaigns. Brands began partnering with creators on trending “challenges” in a bid to attract young new consumers.\n  \n\n      “More people were joining and it was becoming such a fun thing to do,” she said. “Then, it just kind of went away one morning.”\n  \n\n      “If it continued, then I probably could have made enough to have quit my 9 to 5,” she said. “If I had the chance to grow, it could have been a potential career path.”\n  \n\n      This is one of the main arguments TikTok has made in recent weeks in the US. In March, as the company’s CEO prepared to testify before Congress, TikTok produced a docuseries highlighting American small business owners who rely on the platform for their livelihoods.\n  \n\n      The platform is used by nearly five million businesses in the US, TikTok said in March. And it’s set to surpass rivals: London-based research firm Omdia projected in November that TikTok’s advertising revenues will exceed the combined video ad revenues of Meta – home of Facebook and Instagram – and YouTube by 2027.\n  \n\n      This is partly because people are spending more time on TikTok. In the second quarter of 2022, TikTok users globally spent an average of 95 minutes per day on the app, according to data analytics firm SensorTower – nearly twice as much time as users spent on Facebook and Instagram.\n  \n\n      But in Hong Kong, other platforms have jumped in to fill the gap. Reels, Instagram’s short-form video product, with similar features as TikTok such as an endless scroll, is growing quickly – and Dukhande has gotten on board. \n  \n\n      She had to rebuild her audience from scratch, and now has 12,500 Instagram followers, but she feels optimistic about its growth. Still, the loss of TikTok was a “missed opportunity,” she said, and the burgeoning community of creators has largely faded from sight.\n  \n\n      “The amount of jobs, the amount of content creation, the amount of marketing opportunities that were there with TikTok – we sort of missed out on that whole chunk of it.”\n  \n\n      But for some people, TikTok’s departure was a welcome change.\n  \n\n      Poppy Anderson, 16, has been using TikTok since its launch in 2018. And, like many others in her generation, she would spend hours “scrolling and scrolling” – even when feeling unfulfilled.\n  \n\n      “It was very easy to kind of find exactly what you like on there, because the [algorithm-run] For You page kept you there,” she said. “And it’s entertaining, but you don’t really get anything from it.”\n  \n\nThe biggest ways TikTok has changed American culture\n\n\n      She described TikTok as often being a toxic environment that breeds narrow thinking, herd mentality, a misguided “cancel culture” and inappropriate online behavior such as critiquing the bodies of girls and women. Even people she knew in real life began acting differently after joining the app, which strained friendships, she said.\n  \n\n      Martin Poon, 15, also grew weary of TikTok, but it was hard to quit. \n  \n\n      “Everyone was using it, so I feel like there was a sense that you have to use it, you have to be on top of things, you have to know what’s going on. And I think that was stressful to me,” he said. \n  \n\n      Misinformation and misogyny ran rampant on TikTok, with accounts like those of  Andrew Tate, the self-styled “alpha male” recently detained in Romania on allegations of human trafficking and rape, gaining popularity among boys at Poon’s school. \n  \n\n      “It’s just concerning how [these accounts] have so much impact on the youth, and it has so much grip on what we think and how it affects our behavior,” said Poon – though he added that misinformation is a major problem on all social media platforms, not just TikTok.\n  \n\nMisogynistic influencers are trending right now. Defusing their message is a complex task\n\n\n      Experts have long worried about the impact of TikTok on young people’s mental health, with one study claiming the app may surface potentially harmful content related to suicide and eating disorders to teenagers within minutes of them creating an account.\n  \n\n      In response to growing pressure, TikTok recently announced a one-hour daily screentime limit for users under 18, though users will be able to turn off this default setting.\n  \n\n      Anderson acknowledged some positives about TikTok, like open conversations about mental health. Still, she was glad when the app became inaccessible. Falling asleep became easier without the lure of TikTok. “I didn’t have the self control to get off it on my own,” she said.\n  \n\n      For Poon and his friend Ava Chan, also 15, TikTok’s disappearance sparked new beginnings.\n  \n\n      When the app left in 2020, they were doing online classes, isolated from friends and bored at home. At the time, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts had yet to arrive in Hong Kong.\n  \n\n      “We had to figure out how to use our time other than being on TikTok,” said Chan. “For us, that was exploring our passions more.”\n  \n\n      For both, that came in advocating for the neurodiverse community. They launched a club at school that spreads education and awareness about neurodiversity, as well as participating in volunteer activities with neurodiverse people.\n  \n\nTikTok is owned by a Chinese company. So why doesn't it exist there?\n\n\n      Both said it lent them a sense of purpose, and as time went on, they saw other benefits.\n  \n\n      Their friends, who would previously spend time filming and watching TikToks together, began having more face-to-face conversations. They noticed peers begin exercising outdoors more, which was made easier as Covid restrictions lifted. Their mental health improved.\n  \n\n      Of course, being teenagers, they’re not off social media entirely and use it as a tool to promote their club – but it’s far from the previous hours of scrolling. And while they occasionally wonder what’s happening on TikTok outside Hong Kong, the allure of it is lost when nobody else around them uses it either.\n  \n\n      “A lot of people, they’ve just kind of forgotten about it,” said Anderson. “People move to different platforms – or just move on.”\n  \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Fox News is objecting to a couple questions Dominion wants to ask jurors, WWE is merging with UFC to create a new combat-entertainment powerhouse, Bob Iger is hitting back at Florida, detained WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich is appealing his arrest, Elon Musk is creating more Twitter mayhem, \"60 Minutes\" is taking heat for its Marjorie Taylor Greene piece, WGA is calling for a strike authorization vote, and more. But first, the A1.\n\nCovering the Courthouse Circus\nCNN Photo Illustration/Caitlin Ochs/Reuters\nHistory will unfold live before millions of television news viewers on Tuesday as former President Donald Trump travels to Manhattan Criminal Court to be arraigned after last week's unprecedented indictment. \n \nThe extraordinary moment will present newsrooms with a slew of coverage conundrums and test how well outlets have adapted to reporting on Trump since he left office in disgrace and largely vanished from the public view.\n \n\nTo help guide news organizations with tackling this thorny story, I reached out to a few smart members of the industry for their thoughts:\n \n\n► Margaret Sullivan: \"Use what we’ve learned since 2015 about covering Trump (if we really have learned!) and adjust accordingly. Weigh the newsworthiness of the moment against the likelihood of spreading his predictable lies. Fact-checking later is not nearly as effective as putting his statements in context before blasting them out raw. Remember we’re in the truth and democracy business, and let that guide the way.\"\n \n► Bill Grueskin: \"My advice: Ignore the courthouse circus, and focus on the merits of the DA's case. Is there new evidence? Are there new witnesses? What does the indictment tell us that we didn't already know about Trump's payment to Stormy Daniels? And what about that is provably illegal?\"\n \n\n► Jack Shafer: \"Editors and producers should stop looking over their shoulders worrying about what the ox peckers might say about their camera angles, the number of hours they spend on the booking, the number of column inches they burn on the prosecution and trust their own journalistic instincts and training. It's a story, follow it. Inform your readers and viewers.\"\n \n\n► Susan Glasser: \"I’m exhausted by the pre-spin and breathless coverage of an indictment we haven’t seen yet and Trump’s motorcade and plane flying, as if those were momentous events in their own right. The news will be what we learn about the particulars of the case and, if it’s released, the history-making mug shot of the first ever former president to be charged in a criminal case. Trump’s statements since the indictment have made news by being incendiary verging on reckless — and his evening presser is likely to offer more in this vein. In the end, most of this is likely to be a little remembered spectacle that Trump is milking for all it’s worth — and it will be the outcome of this case that will shape its place in history, and what political affect it is eventually judged to have.\"\n\n \n► Preet Bharara: \"Don’t jump the gun. Know there will be surprises. Beware making this some Mano a Mano, Alvin Bragg versus Donald Trump story.\"\n \n\n► Molly Jong-Fast: \"He needs to be covered as a truth sandwich. Tell the truth before you repeat one of his lies. if you can don’t repeat the lies. If you must repeat the lie be sure to say it’s a LIE. Don’t use his campaign’s framing! Don’t let him be your assignment editor. Trump is a candidate and also likely a defendant, treat him like every other candidate and defendant. Don’t give him the benefit of the doubt.\"\n \n\n► Alyssa Farah: \"Be careful not to be spun by Trump world. Trump is currently spiraling over this indictment but he and his team will do everything in their power to try to harness the narrative and frame it as a win for him. Take a step back, contextualize this moment for history: being indicted is never a good thing and it hurts him in a general election regardless of what he says.\"\nCNN Photo Illustration/Drudge Report\n———  BELOW THE FOLD  ———\nCNN Photo Illustration/Bing Guan/Reuters\n\nFox's Jury Fight: Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems on Monday submitted questions that they want asked to potential jurors in the case. Both parties agreed on some questions, including quizzing prospective jurors on which outlets they get their politics/election news from. But as my colleague Marshall Cohen pointed out, Fox News wants to block some of the more politically charged questions that Dominion would like to ask. Those questions, per Cohen, include: \"Do you believe the 2020 Presidential Election may have been stolen?\" and \"Do you believe that the 2020 presidential election was illegitimate or that Joe Biden was fraudulently elected as President.\" The judge gets the final say.\n\n \n\n🔎 Zooming in: Legal experts are noting that Dominion scored big with the judge's Friday ruling on summary judgement. Famed First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams told me it was a \"big step\" for Dominion. \"The resounding findings that Fox repeatedly carried false information about Dominion is certainly a major step forward for it,\" Abrams said. \"As regards the determination that the issue of actual malice remains with the jury, only in the rarest case could that be decided on a motion for summary judgment and it’s no surprise. All in all, though, a good day for Dominion.\" RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor and media law scholar at the University of Utah, told my colleague Jon Passantino that Fox \"cannot be happy\" with the decision. \"The judge’s ruling means that on some of the issues in the case—including that these statements about Dominion rigging the election were false and that Dominion was defamed by them—Dominion has already won,\" Jones said. \"There won’t be any argument about these issues before the jury at all, because the judge has already concluded the evidence doesn’t support Fox.\"\n\nCNN Photo Illustration/Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nUltimate Fighting Combination: It's official: WWE will merge with UFC to create a new combat-entertainment powerhouse. News of the deal leaked over the weekend, with CNBC's Alex Sherman landing the mega-scoop. Details were announced Monday morning. Endeavor will own 51% of the new company. Ari Emanuel will serve as chief executive, Vince McMahon executive chairman, and Mark Shapiro as president and chief operating officer. The deal valued WWE at $9.3 billion and UFC at $12.1 billion. \"This is a rare opportunity to create a global live sports and entertainment pureplay built for where the industry is headed,\" Emanuel said. McMahon added, \"Together, we will be a $21+ billion live sports and entertainment powerhouse with a collective fanbase of more than a billion people and an exciting growth opportunity.\" Endeavor investors weren't thrilled, however. Shares in the company ended Monday ⬇️ 6%.\n\n\nDisney v. DeSantis: Ron DeSantis is irked. The Florida governor on Monday called for a probe after Disney quietly outmaneuvered the company, in a recently disclosed move that has left DeSantis' new board powerless. Meanwhile, Disney boss Bob Iger fired shots at DeSantis at the company's annual shareholder meeting. Iger didn't mention DeSantis by name, but said \"any action\" to \"retaliate for a position the company took sounds not just anti-business, but it sounds anti-Florida.\" CNN's Chris Isidore has more here.\n\nCNN Photo Illustration/CBS News\n\nStahl's Softball Sit-Down: How did anyone at \"60 Minutes\" think this was the correct approach to airing a piece on Marjorie Taylor Greene? In a 13-minute story that aired on the prestigious newsmagazine program, Lesley Stahl failed to meet the moment, churning out a piece that ultimately portrayed Greene in a sympathetic light. Failing to hold her accountable for the countless extremist statements she has made over her years in public life, Stahl instead opened up the piece by letting Greene totally off the hook when she dismissed criticism against her as \"name calling\" from \"troll[s]\" in her Twitter feed. When Stahl asked Greene about her comment that the Democrats are the supposed \"party of pedophiles,\" Greene reiterated her position, to which Stahl only uttered, \"Wow. OK.\" A dereliction of duty, to say the least.\n\nCNN Photo Illustration/Dado Ruvic/Reuters\n\nMore Musk Mayhem: The anticipated purge of legacy checkmarks did not take place on Twitter over the weekend. Instead, Elon Musk only stripped The NYT of its checkmark after learning that the outlet would not pay for a Twitter Blue subscription. The move has already opened the paper up to other users to impersonate its official account. A spokesperson for The NYT only reiterated to me Monday that it will not be paying for a checkmark on the social media site. CNN's Clare Duffy has more here.\n\n \n\n► Why it might be hard: \"Removal of verification badges is a largely manual process powered by a system prone to breaking, which draws on a large internal database — similar to an Excel spreadsheet — in which verification data is stored,\" The WaPo's Rachel Lerman and Faiz Siddiqui report. \"Sometimes, an employee would try to remove a badge but the change wouldn’t take ... prompting workers to explore workarounds. In the past, there was no way to reliably remove badges at a bulk scale.\"\n\n \n\n► What Musk is busy doing instead: Musk on Monday supplanted Twitter's bird logo on the website with an image of a Shiba Inu, an apparent reference to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. The move sent the price of Dogecoin spiking. \"The greater context for this latest bit of Twitter-silliness is that... Musk is in court over dogecoin, looking to dismiss a massive suit relating to the cryptocurrency,\" TechCrunch's Alex Wilhelm notes.\n\n \n► Meanwhile, the lack of Twitter personnel is leading to incidents like this: SB Nation has been locked out of its Twitter account for days and, I'm told, unable to reach anyone to regain access. \"Our appeals to customer support have gone nowhere,\" a source tells me.\nCNN Photo Illustration/Barbara Munker/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nWarning from WGA: The WGA is going there, calling on Monday for a strike authorization vote. \"WGA members must demonstrate our willingness to fight for the contract writers need and deserve by supporting a strike authorization vote,\" the union said Monday. The vote will begin Tuesday, April 11, and last through April 17. The WGA said in an email to members that, thus far, it believes the studios, represented by AGPTP, have \"failed to offer meaningful responses on the core economic issues in any of the WGA’s primary work areas.\" Deadline's Peter White and Dominic Patten have details.\n\nThank you for reading!

                "content": "\nEditor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\n\n      In 1971, an Ivy League graduate in his mid-20s rented a studio apartment on Third Avenue and 75th Street in New York City. The window looked out on an adjoining building’s water tank.\n  \n\n      “I … tried to divide it up so that it would seem bigger. But no matter what I did, it was still a dark, dingy little apartment. Even so, I loved it,” wrote former President Donald Trump in his 1987 book, “The Art of the Deal,” co-authored with Tony Schwartz. “You have to understand; I was a kid from Queens who worked in Brooklyn, and suddenly I had an apartment on the Upper East Side. … I became a city guy instead of a kid from the boroughs.” \n  \n\n      Trump was not the last person to fall under the spell of Manhattan, with its fast pace, its soaring towers and its glamorous celebrities. There, he would build his career, endure divorces and business bankruptcies, become a mythical figure through his starring role on “The Apprentice” and mount an unlikely campaign for president. \n  \n\n      Ultimately, he’d become the first New Yorker since Franklin D. Roosevelt to make it to the White House. But Trump’s Manhattan saga could be coming to a close on Tuesday only a few miles from where it began, when he is scheduled to appear in a downtown courtroom to face criminal charges. \n  \n\n      As with almost everything about the former president, there’s no real precedent for the latest chapter of his story — and no way to tell how it will end.\n  \n\n      “It finally happened,” wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers. “After multiple investigations over half a dozen years, former President Donald Trump has been indicted by a grand jury in New York, according to sources familiar with the matter. Trump fired back, calling the indictment ‘political persecution’ and warned ‘this Witch-Hunt’ will backfire.”\n  \n\n      “Though we not yet know the details of the charges, we do know that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had been investigating Trump in connection with his alleged role in a hush money cover-up scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign…It is the first time any former president has been criminally charged. As such, we are entering uncharted territory.”\n  \n\n      “It should be evident that no one is above the law, and that Trump should be held accountable for his actions in the way that any other citizen would be. These charges represent the first step toward accountability, but the journey will be long and winding.” \n  \n\n      Trump can continue running for the Republican nomination for president in 2024 and if he can delay the prosecution and is elected, Rodgers pointed out, “expect him to argue that the case against him must be dismissed as unconstitutional based on the Justice Department’s 2000 guidance that a president cannot be indicted ‘or tried’ while in office.” \n  \n\nElie Honig argued that the first hurdle for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is to overcome any motion by Trump’s lawyer to dismiss the charges. But even if he succeeds there, his prosecutors have to convince 12 jurors to vote unanimously to convict. \n  \n\n      “Even if a case was tried in a part of the country where Trump isn’t very popular, statistically you are very likely to end up with one or more Trump voters on the jury of 12 people,” said Honig. “A judge would tell jurors to put aside their political views and personal beliefs — but I know from my days as a prosecutor that jurors are human beings, not robots — they’re subject to the same emotions, biases, and incentives as any person would be. And the legal bar at trial is far higher than in the grand jury…”\n  \n\n      In the political arena, “there is a distinct possibility that Trump not only survives but also thrives,” wrote Julian Zelizer. “Trump has an uncanny instinct for using moments of peril to his advantage and his political career is built on punching back against the people and institutions he claims are unfairly attacking him. He has already fallen back on the well-worn strategy of presenting himself as the victim of a corrupt establishment and rallying his supporters behind him.” \n  \n\n      “It must be said that of all the legal troubles Trump faces, the indictment in New York appears to pale in comparison to others, such as the potential racketeering and conspiracy charges Atlanta-area prosecutors are considering in connection to the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.”\n  \n\n      In the Washington Post, Henry Olsen wrote, “Anyone who cares about fairness in our criminal justice system should be queasy that Donald Trump will be prosecuted in one of the country’s most liberal jurisdictions. By all accounts, this should be a federal case.”\n  \n\n      “New York state’s entire judicial process is controlled by Democrats who could lose their positions in party primaries. Alvin Bragg, the district attorney overseeing the case, boasted during his campaign that he had sued Trump or his administration more than 100 times during his tenure in the state attorney general’s office, something he probably did to curry favor with primary voters who loathe Trump. Every New York state judge who would either try the case or hear an appeal is elected on a partisan basis, too. It would take a lot of courage for a judge to apply the law fairly and potentially ignore their voters’ desire for vengeance.” \n  \n\n      Sorrow, anger and frustration were among the emotions people felt after yet another school shooting last week — this time in Nashville, Tennessee, where three children and three adults were killed at The Covenant School on Monday. \n  \n\nJillian Peterson and James Densley have been studying the life histories of nearly 200 mass shooters since 1996. Their findings are instructive — “85% showed similar warning signs of a crisis and 92% were suicidal. Further, 93% of school mass shooters communicated violent intent ahead of time and 86% showed a high degree of planning before the shooting. Lastly, 73% of all school mass shooters had a history of childhood trauma…” \n  \n\n      All of this raises the question of how to prevent shootings. And they argued that on this front, there is a positive development — a move to hold parents accountable in certain cases:\n  \n\n      “The parents of a teenager who shot and killed four students at Oxford High School in Michigan in November 2021 are set to stand trial for involuntary manslaughter after an appellate court last week rejected their contention that the charges have no legal justification,” Peterson and Densely observed.\n  \n\n      “James and Jennifer Crumbley, who have pleaded not guilty, allegedly neglected cries for help from their son for months and dismissed serious concerns from the school the day before and the morning of the shooting. Yet even as they apparently ignored warning signs, the Crumbleys bought their son a gun and took him to target practice. Fifteen at the time of the mass shooting, their son pleaded guilty in October to terrorism and murder charges.” \n  \n\n      President Joe Biden touted efforts to oppose autocratic governments at last week’s White House democracy summit, co-hosted by Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia.\n  \n\n      But there was one country missing from the gathering — Afghanistan, wrote Peter Bergen. \n  \n\n      “This makes the premise of the democracy summit ring somewhat hollow because while the Biden administration does an excellent job of trumpeting its commitments to democracy and women’s rights, only a year and a half ago, it cavalierly abandoned 40 million Afghans to the Taliban’s misogynistic theocracy.”\n  \n\n      House Republicans are investigating the tumultuous US withdrawal from Afghanistan and there’s a congressionally mandated bipartisan commission examining the entire 20-year war in Afghanistan. “Of course, any examination of the US record in Afghanistan is something of a double-edged sword for Republicans,” Bergen noted, “since it was the Trump administration that signed the agreement with the Taliban in 2020 that set the stage for the total US withdrawal from Afghanistan.”\n  \n\n      The drama playing out in Israel this week offered an indicator of how protest can make a difference in a democracy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who’s back in office on the strength of an extreme right-wing coalition, has been pressing for an overhaul of the country’s judiciary to place it firmly under the control of the Knesset. “For Netanyahu, the plan was convenient,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “It created the possibility of escaping his own legal woes, since one of the controversial bills recently passed would make it more difficult for a prime minister to be declared unfit for office… \n  \n\n      “It might seem an arcane issue to trigger a massive popular uprising, but Israelis promptly concluded their democracy was at stake, and what followed was one of the most far-reaching, disciplined and determined waves of protests inside a democratic country in recent memory.”\n  \n\n      “On Monday, under nearly unbearable pressure, Netanyahu agreed to postpone the overhaul -— which was being rammed through the Knesset — until the next legislative term. The crisis, however, is not over.”\n  \n\n      For more: \n  \n\nAnshel Pfeffer: What on earth was Netanyahu thinking?\n\n\n      “Breakups suck.” So goes the introductory video for a campaign that New Zealand is conducting to help people cope with relationships that have ended. “Our behavior doesn’t have to” follow suit, wrote Holly Thomas.\n  \n\n      “The nation’s Love Better campaign … aims to help young people recover from breakups and build resilience. The campaign includes a dedicated phone, text or email helpline run by Youthline, an organization dedicated to supporting people ages 12 to 24.”\n  \n\n      “It’s part of a broader strategy to help eliminate family and sexual violence, and it follows a survey of 1,200 16-24-year-olds, 68% of whom reported experiences encompassing self-harm, substance abuse, risky sexual behaviors and violence and coercion following rejection. Given the breadth of the potential damage, it’s wild that campaigns like these aren’t ubiquitous in other countries as well … At the very least, it would improve our collective mental health. At most, it might save lives.”\n  \n\n      Is Utah leading the way in fixing what’s wrong with social media? Kara Alaimo thinks so. Under two new state laws, “social media companies have to verify the ages of all users in the state, and children under age 18 have to get permission from their parents to have accounts.”\n  \n\n      “Parents will also be able to access their kids’ accounts, apps won’t be allowed to show children ads, and accounts for kids won’t be able to be used between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. without parental permission.”\n  \n\n      “It’s about time,” wrote Alaimo. “Social networks in the United States have become potentially incredibly dangerous for children, and parents can no longer protect our kids without the tools and safeguards this law provides. … Congress should follow Utah’s lead and enact a similar law to protect every child in this country.”\n  \n\n      For more:\n  \n\nMary Ziegler and Naomi Cahn: From Michelangelo’s David to the 2024 presidential race, ‘parents’ rights’ are everywhere\n\n\n      Last weekend, Russian President Vladimir Putin expanded on his plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus, which borders both Russia and Ukraine. There was very little new in the announcement, wrote Keir Giles, but it still set off alarms that the analyst thinks are exaggerated. \n  \n\n      “The flurry of alarmist reporting on what this meant highlights much of what is wrong with Western responses to Russian nuclear intimidation.”\n  \n\n      “How Putin’s words have been spun in the West may be a surprise to Moscow — but there’s no doubt it will be a highly gratifying one. Because Russia has already ‘used’ nuclear weapons. It’s used them highly successfully without firing them, by trading on empty threats about potential nuclear strikes to very effectively deter the West from fully supporting Ukraine against Russia’s imperialist war.”\n  \n\n“By now though, we should have learned not to confuse what Putin has said with what Russia has done or is about to do.”\n\n\nDavid Axelrod: The sports whiz who might just save Major League Baseball\n\n\nMarja Heinonen: Finland’s the happiest country once again.

In a piece for CNN Opinion, Roy Schwartz explored his back story, and that of the artist, who adopted the name of Jack Kirby. Both writer and artist were the children of Jewish immigrants.\n  \n\n      Schwartz wrote that Kirby’s son said “he was fearful and furious at the rise of Nazism in Europe and the US, especially after (British prime minister Neville) Chamberlain’s appeasement and Kristallnacht. He and Simon created their hero in direct response, and Kirby plainly stated, ‘Captain America was myself.’ When he drew him punching Hitler, it was his ‘own anger coming to the surface.’”\n  \n\n      That was far from Kirby’s only contribution to the history of comics. \n  \n\n      As Schwartz noted, “After the war, superheroes fell out of favor and Kirby wrote and drew other genres of comics. When Stan Lee, by then the editor and head writer at what would soon be named Marvel, asked him to try superheroes again in 1961, the two created together the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Thor, Ant-Man, Iron Man, the Avengers, the X-Men, Black Panther and countless others. This, combined with his artistic innovation, earned Kirby the moniker ‘King of Comics.’ It also made him one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.” \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nEditor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\n\n      “O, for a muse of fire,” pleads the chorus at the outset of William Shakespeare’s “Henry V.” It seeks to “ascend the brightest heaven of invention” and conjure up “the vasty fields of France” on a tiny stage to transport the audience back in history.\n  \n\n      Drama could be had last week without a need for the kind of exertions Shakespeare and his troupe employed at London’s Globe theater more than 400 years ago. \n  \n\n      A former president of the United States appeared in a New York courtroom to face criminal charges. The borders of NATO grew dramatically as Finland joined the alliance. Pivotal elections in Wisconsin and Chicago demonstrated voters’ increasing affinity for progressive politics. Tennessee legislators targeted three members of the state House for joining a gun control protest in the chamber, expelling two young Black men while failing to oust a 60-year-old White woman. \n  \n\n      And then on Friday evening, a federal judge in Texas issued a ruling suspending the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval, granted 23 years ago, of one of two drugs often used in medication abortions, which now account for a majority of all abortions in America. (He gave the Biden administration a week to appeal the ruling before it goes into effect. Meanwhile, a judge in Washington state ruled in a different case that the government must continue to make the drug available in 17 states and the District of Columbia.)  \n  \n\n      Thus, the week that began with Trump facing a judge in Manhattan ended with a Trump-appointed judge overturning more than two decades of medical practice. It was another sign that Trump’s impact — particularly his choice of three conservative Supreme Court judges who helped overturn the right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade — has outlasted his four years in office.\n  \n\n      The abortion issue not only helped shape the outcome of Wisconsin’s judicial election Tuesday, it also figured in an emerging debate over the right of Americans to travel to other states for medical procedures.   \n  \n\nMary Ziegler and Naomi Cahn observed that a new Idaho law, labeled an “abortion trafficking” measure, “criminalizes anyone who helps a minor get an abortion or abortion pills without parental consent. Violators will face felony charges and up to five years in prison.”\n  \n\n      “The law could treat anyone, from friends to grandparents, as traffickers … Idaho Republicans presented the bill as a common-sense protection of parental rights.”\n  \n\n      “But make no mistake: Idaho’s bill is part of a broader attack on the right to travel for adults as well as minors, and the stakes of whittling away at that right are higher than ever.” Meanwhile Idaho’s attorney general withdrew a controversial letter he issued last month that said the state “prohibits an Idaho medical provider from either referring a woman across state lines to access abortion services or prescribing abortion pills for the woman to pick up across state lines.”\n  \n\n      The Republicans in the Tennessee state House of Representatives who expelled Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were “using their power as a tool of intimidation,” wrote Jemar Tisby. “What other conclusion can be drawn from the inappropriate and disproportionate response to a decorum infraction?” \n  \n\n      But their tactic backfired in a spectacular way, Tisby wrote. The vote has raised the profile of the two state representatives to national prominence, and “instead of dissuading Tennesseans from their calls for gun control, Republican legislators seem to have energized the people and motivated them to resist even more vigorously.”\n  \n\n      As SE Cupp observed, some Republican leaders and right-wing commentators have described the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol as “totally fine, no big deal, and those protesters are patriots who should be left alone. But the three Democratic lawmakers who briefly protested inaction on gun control — a protest that led to zero violence and wasn’t an attempted crime — that’s unacceptable and those lawmakers should lose their jobs.”  \n  \n\n      In Cupp’s view, it’s “another example of the GOP attacking democracy. They haven’t been able to convince a majority of voters to support their far-right extreme agenda, so instead they want to make it harder to vote, harder to protest, harder to access information.”\n  \n\n      Trump’s critics had waited years for this moment. His supporters had spent months bitterly denouncing the process leading up to it. But when the former president took his seat at the defense table in a Manhattan criminal courtroom Tuesday, the event was something of an anti-climax. \n  \n\n      “Beneath the familiar swoop of dyed-blond hair and thick foundation, his expression was grim and reserved,” wrote Nicole Hemmer. “For the moment, he was just another defendant, dependent on a judge to determine his next move. And while Trump will work hard in the coming hours and days to offer a different reading of those images — and media outlets will be tempted to help him out by focusing on the spectacle — they depict not a departure from regular order, but rather its return.”\n  \n\n      Trump wanted a mug shot, according to two sources cited by CNN, but he didn’t get one. “Instead of a defiant N.Y.P.D. photo or a raised fist,” David Firestone wrote in the New York Times, “the lasting image of the day may well be that of a humbled former president looking hunched, angry and nervous at the courtroom defense table, a suddenly small man wedged between his lawyers, as two New York State court officers loomed behind him in a required posture of making sure the defendant stayed in his place.” \n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      In some ways, a prosecution of Trump was a long time coming, observed Fareed Zakaria. “For decades he has flouted rules, norms and even laws as he climbed his way to the top, brazenly convinced that the usual standards didn’t apply to him. His company was found guilty of tax fraud, he’s been taken to court countless times over unpaid bills, and he’s even stolen money from his own charities.”\n  \n\n      But was this the right case to bring? “The prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, is an elected district attorney who ran a campaign for that office boasting that he had helped sue Donald Trump ‘more than a hundred times,’” Zakaria noted. “Even so, once elected and after looking over the evidence, he is reported to have put the case on the back burner, which triggered a storm of criticism from his Democratic base. He then reversed course and decided to pursue the case on a new basis, if reported accounts are correct … this case has the feel of zealous prosecutors minutely examining all possibilities to find some violation of the law.”\n  \n\nJohn Dean and Norman Eisen argued that “there’s no good reason to exempt Trump from prosecution when his former lawyer Michael Cohen went to prison for his role in surreptitiously moving these funds to benefit the campaign, as have others for similar conduct.”\n  \n\n      “The violation for falsifying books and records is a clear one: These were alleged hush-money payments by Trump and his entities that they are accused of falsely entering into their records as legal fees.” \n  \n\n      In contrast, David Orentlicher, wrote that “Trump’s relationship with adult film star Stormy Daniels and his alleged payments to her, via his former lawyer Michael Cohen, raise substantial ethical concerns — but they are not matters that should be addressed in a courtroom.” \n  \n\n      President Joe Biden noted in a CNN Opinion commentary that Passover is all about telling “the miraculous story of the Jewish people’s exodus from slavery in Egypt to freedom. It is a timeless, powerful story of faith, hope and redemption that has inspired oppressed people everywhere for generations.”\n  \n\n      “But Passover is more than just a recounting of the past. It is also a cautionary tale of the present and our future as a democracy. As Jews read from the Haggadah about how evil in every generation has tried to destroy them, antisemitism is rising to record levels today,” Biden wrote. \n  \n\n      He described several ways the government is addressing the issue. “But government alone cannot root out antisemitism and hate. All Americans, including businesses and community leaders, educators, students, athletes, entertainers and influencers must help confront bigotry in all its forms. We must each do our part to create a culture of respect in our workplaces, in our schools, on our social media and in our homes.”\n  \n\n“Because hate never goes away, it only hides until it is given just a little oxygen.” \n\n\n      Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has suffered setback after setback. One of his biggest defeats came Tuesday, when Finland officially joined NATO. \n  \n\n      In launching the war in February 2022, “Putin argued that his goal was to prevent NATO from expanding,” as Frida Ghitis recalled. “On that count, Putin not only failed, but in fact propelled the very development he sought to prevent. Now Russia’s border with NATO countries has more than doubled in length, adding an extra 830 miles of frontier with Finland.”\n  \n\n      “Finland, which was once part of the Russian empire … will move quickly to fortify that long border. That’s because when Russia invaded Ukraine, it sent an unmistakable signal to its neighbors that it simply could not be trusted.” \n  \n\n      This weekend’s holidays of Good Friday and Easter have fundamentally different messages in some contexts, according to religious studies scholar Bart D. Ehrman. \n  \n\n      One view sees Jesus on Easter as “the Christ of the Apocalypse, where the ‘lamb who was slaughtered’ comes back for blood, wreaking vengeance on a world that rejected him before judging the earth and ordering those who are not among his most faithful followers to be thrown into a lake of burning sulfur.”\n  \n\n      The better course is the message of Good Friday: the Jesus of the Gospels, Ehrman writes. His followers “are not to assert power or ‘lord it over others.’ They are to be humble and meek. They are to feed the hungry, welcome strangers, tend to the sick, sell what they have and give to the poor — even those they don’t know, strangers, foreigners, followers of other religions. Most emphatically, Jesus insists his followers not be violent, not seek revenge, not return evil for evil. They are to turn the other cheek; they are to love their enemies.” \n  \n\n      For more: \n  \n\nKathryn Reklis: Why I finally decided to watch ‘The Chosen’\n\n\n      Sweden’s Greta Thunberg was joined by Stanford student organizer Sophia Kianni and Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate in warning that the Biden administration is going down the wrong path by greenlighting the Willow Project in Alaska and opening 73 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling. \n  \n\n      “Young people and members of marginalized communities are the ones who will bear the brunt of the consequences of the escalating climate emergency,” they wrote. “The rubber-stamping of such a project sends a message not just to our generation but humanity as a whole: The future of our planet and the present well-being of frontline communities are being sacrificed for short-term economic gain and political expediency.”\n  \n\n      On the right, Trump’s indictment energized the MAGA base, giving the former president a lift over potential rivals for the 2024 nomination. But on the left, a victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election Tuesday suggested that Democrats may be better positioned to assemble winning voter coalitions than their GOP rivals — particularly when abortion is a leading issue.  \n  \n\n      “If Republicans are going to reverse their fortunes in” the suburban counties surrounding Milwaukee, “they’re going to have to settle the abortion issue,” observed James Wigderson, a Wisconsin-based conservative writer. “According to the Marquette University Law School poll, the majority of independent voters remains consistently opposed to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe. Those independent voters, especially women, are now pulling the lever for the Democrats.” \n  \n\n      “But Republicans are also going to have to end the blood contract with Trump. The trend of the Republicans losing suburban votes began before Roe v. Wade was overturned.” \n  \n\n      For more on politics: \n  \n\nJulian Zelizer: The Clarence Thomas revelations are the last straw\n\n\nClay Cane: The fight against ‘woke’ is really conservative gaslighting\n\n\n      “Something incredible happened this past weekend,” wrote Amy Bass. “Americans went to bed Sunday night talking about women’s basketball and woke up Monday morning still going on and on about it.”\n  \n\n      Angel Reese, the star of Louisiana State University’s winning team, pushed back at criticism of her “so-called taunting of (Iowa’s Caitlin) Clark in the last seconds of the championship game, with the racialized vitriol that accused her of being ‘classless’ or ‘unsportsmanlike’ demonstrating vividly the double standard Black athletes are all too familiar with,” noted Bass.\n  \n\n      “When other people do it, y’all don’t say nothing,” Reese pointed out, after the team’s victory. “This was for the people who look like me.”\n  \n\n      First lady Jill Biden, who watched the game in person, initially suggested that both LSU and Iowa deserved an invite to the White House because of the quality of play. But the White House soon made clear that, following tradition, only the winning team will go. Bass wrote: “Iowa doesn’t get an invite to the White House. They lost. Let’s not do that. Let’s not go there.” \n  \n\nJewel: What we get wrong about mental health \n\n\nRon Avi Astor: While school shootings spread fear, there is some comforting data on school violence\n\n\nNoah Berlatsky: ‘Air’ proves Hollywood can make you root for anyone\n\n\nDean Obeidallah: Why is ’60 Minutes’ amplifying the views of Marjorie Taylor Greene?\n\n\nAni Bundel: ‘Grease’ reboot comes 45 years after the original — and right on time\n\n\nDana Peterson and Frank Steemers: How safe is your job?\n\n\nJane Holgate: Fed up workers are turning to a 1970s throwback\n\n\nAndrea Askowitz: What Justine Bateman gets exactly right about beauty\n\n\nAND…\n\n\n      Making electric scooters widely available on city streets sounds “great in theory,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “In practice, they’re much more of a menace than a convenience.”\n\n\n      “Over the past few years, electric scooters have been brought to Paris and dozens of other cities worldwide by various startups promising an environmentally-friendly individual transport option. What cities have gotten instead is chaos: scooters shooting down sidewalks at dangerous speeds or laying abandoned on pedestrian thoroughfares. Both riders and pedestrians have been injured and sometimes killed.”\n  \n\n      Ninety percent of the roughly 100,000 people who voted in Paris want the scooters banned. “One problem with scooters is that there is no obvious spot for them within urban infrastructure,” Filipovic noted. “They go far too fast to be safe on the sidewalk” and aren’t right for bike lanes or roads either.\n  \n\n      “Why does anyone think this is a good idea?”\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nDonald Trump is the first former president to be indicted. Given that move by a New York grand jury and the other high-profile criminal cases involving Trump, you might think his political fortunes are endangered. \n  \n\n      But many Republican officials seem hesitant to attack the former president (instead turning on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the charges), and betting markets still favor Trump for the GOP nomination in 2024. \n  \n\n      So what’s going on? We’re in an obviously unprecedented situation, and the political reality can change post-indictment. \n  \n\n      Still, Republicans and bettors are likely reacting to three facts: \n  \n\n      Recent polls from Fox News, Monmouth University and Quinnipiac University have shown how Trump’s Republican primary prospects have improved. All had Trump leading by double digits in March, with his advantage over his nearest rival – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an undeclared 2024 candidate – growing by 12 points since February. \n  \n\nRepublican leaders and Trump loyalists on Capitol Hill rally behind the former president after indictment\n\n\n      According to the Quinnipiac poll, which was published this past week, just 18% of registered Republican voters thought the accusations against Trump in the alleged hush money scheme in New York were very or somewhat serious. A majority (53%) believed they were not serious at all. \n  \n\n      The fact that the indictment is now a real (not just potential) occurrence could change some opinions, though perhaps not as many as you might think. \n  \n\n      Most Republicans (and, in fact, a majority of all voters) in the same Quinnipiac poll didn’t believe the man bringing those charges (Bragg) was an unbiased observer. Nearly every Republican (93%) thought his case was mainly motivated by politics. Most voters (63%) thought the same thing. \n  \n\n      Indeed, when it comes to any indictment, Republicans seem to have adopted a viewpoint favorable to Trump. A Marist College poll published this past week asked respondents which view of all the different Trump investigations came closer to their own: that they were fair or that they were a “witch hunt.” \n  \n\n      While 55% of all voters said they were fair, just 18% of Republicans and 14% of 2020 Trump voters believed that they were. Most Republicans (80%) and 2020 Trump voters (84%) told Marist that the investigations were a “witch hunt.” \n  \n\n      The polling results are consistent with what we know about how Republicans feel about the underlying information at the center of the different probes. \n  \n\n      Beyond the New York case, surveys also show that a majority of Republicans believe that Trump did not commit a crime in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. Likewise, polling indicates that most Republicans believe Trump was righteous in those efforts, with a majority continuing to believe the falsehood that Joe Biden only won the election because of voter fraud. \n  \n\n      Of course, the fact that Republicans believe these cases are politically motivated is only part of what is at play here. \n  \n\nWhy Trump is a clear favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination\n\n\n      The other component is how Republicans view Trump in the context of the broader general electorate. Conceivably, Republicans might think Trump is innocent, while also believing that his legal issues could harm him in the general election. After all, most voters think the investigations are fair. \n  \n\n      But surveys show that for Republican voters, agreement on the issues is more important than electability when it comes to making their primary choices. In our most recent CNN/SSRS poll, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents indicated, by a 59% to 41% majority, that beating Biden was a higher priority than agreement on the issues. \n  \n\n      Trump’s supporters were no different. Sixty-one percent said issue agreement tops electability, while 39% of them disagreed. \n  \n\n      This is a massive difference from what occurred in the 2020 Democratic primary. By March 2020, 73% of Biden backers were telling pollsters that electability was more important than issue agreement. \n  \n\n      Put another way, Biden’s case to Democratic voters relied on electability in a way that Trump’s case to Republicans does not. \n  \n\n      This may be why Trump still leads, despite a majority of Republicans already believing that their best chance to beat Biden lies with other potential nominees. According to a Marist poll from February, 54% of Republicans thought someone other than Trump would give the party the best chance of taking back the White House in 2024. \n  \n\n      Of course, Republican voters may not necessarily be wrong in their calculations this year. Even with all the potential electability problems, Trump has been ahead of Biden in more general election polls in the early part of the 2024 cycle than he was over the entirety of the 2020 cycle. The same polling shows that DeSantis tends to do a few points better against Biden than Trump does, which matches up with what a majority of Republicans think. \n  \n\n      The big question going forward is what happens now that Trump has been indicted? Will Republicans continue to stick with him? Will electability matter more if Trump’s poll numbers weaken considerably against Biden? \n  \n\n      We don’t know the answers, but what we can say is the current political environment is one that is not harming Trump in the GOP primary. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, endorsed former President Donald Trump Monday night. \n  \n\n      “The best four years I’ve had in the US Senate is when President Trump was serving in the Oval Office,” Daines told Donald Trump Jr. on Trump’s Rumble show, “Triggered.”\n  \n\n      “You talk about results – we passed and he signed the greatest tax cut in American history. We transformed the courts – the Supreme Court, the circuit courts. … We had a country that was respected and strong,” said Daines, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.”\n  \n\nTrump's GOP rivals struggle to break through as former president cements frontrunner status  \n\n\n      As head of the NRSC, Daines’ job is to help Republicans win the Senate in 2024. The party, which currently holds a narrow 51-49 majority, must defend 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs this cycle. That means Republicans need a net gain of just one or two seats to retake the Senate, depending on which party wins the White House in 2024.\n  \n\n      One source close to the Trump campaign described the endorsement as not only a political win, but a financial win as well. In his role, Daines has access to a vast network of wealthy Republican donors, many of whom have attempted to distance themselves from the former president this cycle. There is a hope, according to this source, that Daines’ endorsement could help boost Trump’s fundraising.  \n  \n\n      After the 2022 midterms, when there was some consternation among GOP leaders over Trump’s backing of untested candidates, the NRSC under Daines has taken a much more hands-on approach to primaries, actively working on candidate recruitment and vetting.\n  \n\n      As CNN previously reported, the NRSC is weighing whether to spend big bucks in primaries to help root out weaker candidates, a move that risks setting up a clash with hard-right candidates aligning themselves with Trump. The GOP’s best pick-up opportunities lie in three states Trump won where Democratic senators are up for reelection next year, including Daines’ home state of Montana. \n  \n\n      Privately, Daines has spoken multiple times with Trump and has been in touch with his eldest son. The goal, GOP sources told CNN earlier this month, is to keep Trump aligned with Republican leadership – even as the former president has furiously attacked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the aftermath of the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, and as the Senate GOP leader has stayed silent amid the former president’s indictment on 34 felony charges in New York. Daines, however, has been vocal in his defense of Trump.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n\n  Manu Raju and Alayna Treene contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Kari Lake – the unapologetic supporter of former President Donald Trump and vanquished candidate for Arizona governor – privately made a trip to National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters in February where she discussed the prospects of shaking up the map and running for Senate.  \n  \n\n      But Lake, who has faced blowback over pushing baseless accusations of election fraud, was given this suggestion from NRSC officials: Shift to more effective messaging and away from claims about a stolen election, according to sources familiar with the matter.     \n  \n\n      The meeting, which was described as a positive one, focused on how Senate bids often turn on issues that are different than governor’s races, multiple sources said. Top Republicans quietly acknowledge Lake could become a frontrunner if she runs in the primary, hoping to steer her towards a viable campaign if she mounts one, even as Arizona’s Pinal County sheriff is expected to soon jump into the race while independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema actively prepares a reelection bid herself.  \n  \n\n      And that’s just one state.  \n  \n\n      The Arizona race is one of several landmines that Republican leaders are navigating as they work behind the scenes to avoid a repeat of the 2022 debacle that saw weaker candidates emerge from contested primaries – only to peter out and collapse in the general election and hand Democrats a 51-49 Senate majority. Several of those candidates were backed by Trump as the NRSC – run at the time by Florida Sen. Rick Scott – opted to stay away from Republican primaries.     \n  \n\n      Now, the NRSC – run by Sen. Steve Daines of Montana – has taken a much more hands-on approach to primaries, actively working on candidate recruitment and vetting. And the committee is weighing whether to spend big bucks in primaries to help root out weaker candidates, a move that risks setting up a clash with hard-right candidates aligning themselves with Trump.     \n  \n\n      “You need to learn from your past mistakes,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, told CNN. “If you don’t make adjustments, doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome, it’s insanity.”  \n  \n\n      Privately, Daines has spoken multiple times with Trump and has been in touch with his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., while national Republicans point to the NRSC’s early endorsement and fundraising for Rep. Jim Banks in the Indiana Senate race as an example of how the party’s warring wings can try to avoid messy primaries.    \n  \n\n      The goal, GOP sources say, is to keep Trump aligned with Republican leadership – even as the former president has furiously attacked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the aftermath of the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, and as the Senate GOP leader has stayed silent amid the former president’s indictment on 34 felony charges in New York. Daines, however, has been vocal in his defense of Trump.    \n  \n\n      “I have a very good relationship with the president. We talk, and it’s no secret we’ve been friends for a long time,” Daines told CNN when asked about the Senate races. “And he provides great insights. And I also provide my thoughts as well. And we have open lines of communication.”      \n  \n\n      Daines added: “Wherever we can find common ground is a good thing.”     \n  \n\n      That relationship could be put to the test in key battleground states. In West Virginia, Republican leaders are preparing to close ranks behind Gov. Jim Justice, who is seriously weighing a run for the seat occupied by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. A Justice bid would put him against Rep. Alex Mooney, who had won Trump’s backing in a competitive House race in the last cycle but now has the support of the conservative Club for Growth’s political arm.  \n  \n\n      In Pennsylvania, Doug Mastriano – the controversial candidate who lost a bid for governor last fall but had the support of Trump in the primary – says he’s “still praying” on whether to mount a bid for the Senate, something Republicans in Washington fear. The NRSC plans to put its muscle behind the potential candidacy of David McCormick, the hedge fund executive who narrowly lost the Pennsylvania Senate GOP primary in 2022, according to Republican sources who view him as their best bet at picking up the seat next year.\n  \n\n      “I haven’t decided yet on 2024. I’m thinking about it,” McCormick told CNN. “You run for office … because you think you have something to contribute. You think it’s a moment where you might be able to serve, and if you lose, that motivation doesn’t necessarily go away.”   \n\n\n      And in Montana, Rep. Matt Rosendale, a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, is weighing a run in a race that could put him up against two other potential candidates viewed by senior Republicans as more electable – Montana attorney general Austin Knudsen and businessman Tim Sheehy – against Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Rosendale attended an event last Tuesday in Mar-a-Lago following Trump’s arraignment in New York, a sign one Trump adviser saw as an effort to secure an endorsement ahead of a potential bid. \n  \n\n      Rosendale told CNN he’s in no rush to make a decision.  \n  \n\n      “We’re just taking a nice slow time to let the people in Montana decide who they want to replace him with,” Rosendale said of Tester. “I feel very sure he will be replaced.” He added that Daines “is my senator” and that “I see him regularly.”   \n  \n\n      Tester contended that the Republican nominee makes little difference to him.  \n  \n\n      “I think the person who runs against me is the person McConnell chooses,” Tester said. “Whoever that is, I don’t think it matters much: Same election.”  \n  \n\n      Top Republicans say they will have to make key strategic decisions on how to engage in some of these races – or whether to stay out altogether, as they might in Ohio as party leaders view the emerging field as full of electable candidates against Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.   \n  \n\n      If they come in too aggressively, it could prompt blowback and rally the right behind a potentially weaker candidate. But if they disengage, they could see their favored candidate struggle to gain traction.  \n  \n\n      In Wisconsin, Republican officials are urging Rep. Mike Gallagher to run, though he could face a potential primary there as well, as former Senate candidate Eric Hovde and others weigh a run. Gallagher, who is chairing a House panel focused on China, said of a potential run against Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin: “I’m not thinking about it at present,” citing his legislative work and family commitments. But he left the door open.  \n  \n\n      “I’d never conceived of this as a long-term thing; I don’t think Congress should be a career,” Gallagher said, adding: “I’m going to weigh all those factors and see where I can make the best impact.”  \n  \n\n      In interviews with roughly a dozen top senators, nearly all of them agreed they need to be hyper-focused this cycle on helping candidates who can win not only a primary election, but a general election — repeatedly referencing “candidate quality” as their 2024 motto.   \n  \n\n      Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of Senate GOP leadership and former NRSC chairman, has long had to contend with primary fights between the party establishment and activist base – battles that had effectively cost them the chance at the Senate majority in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles, in addition to 2022. \n\n\n      “It never goes away,” Cornyn said of the primary complications. “Republicans need to make up their mind. Do we want to win, or do we want to lose? And I think that it’s that simple, and I think people are tired of losing.”     \n  \n\n      Yet some on the right are warning against party leaders picking and choosing their candidates – including Scott, who defends his hands-off approach in the last cycle.    \n  \n\n      “I believe the citizens of the state ought to pick,” Scott said, adding: “A lot of these weaker candidates often are the ones who actually win. I was not the establishment candidate.”    \n  \n\n      Scott’s fellow Florida Republican, Marco Rubio, was not backed by the NRSC in the 2010 election cycle. But he galvanized the GOP base and defeated Charlie Crist, who later became a Democrat.    \n  \n\n      “I’m not a big believer that you can determine who the weaker candidate is. A lot of people up here then would not have been their choice,” Rubio told CNN. “Obviously there might be some exceptions here or there, but generally the NRSC should be engaged in helping whoever the Republican nominee is to win the general election.”    \n  \n\n      Unlike the last cycle — when the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund and the Rick Scott-run NRSC clashed publicly over the approach to expanding the Senate map — this time, the two committees are largely aligned. Republicans are betting that their preferred chances will vastly improve with the help of big donors and nationwide fundraising – and potentially an aggressive ad campaign in the primary to derail weaker opponents.  \n  \n\n      “As we look across the country and look at different traces, it’s pretty straightforward,” Daines said. “We want to see candidates who can win a primary election and also win a general.”    \n  \n\n      The map heavily favors the GOP – with 23 Democratic and independent seats in cycle compared to just 11 Republicans facing re-election. But Republicans, burnt by their past failures, are well aware that defeating an incumbent is a difficult task and could grow more challenging in a presidential election year, especially in swing states if Trump is the nominee. Behind the scenes, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is trying to limit Democratic retirements. \n  \n\n      And Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was skeptical that a more aggressive GOP intervention from Washington would solve Republican woes.    \n  \n\n      “I’m not sure who the Republicans will put forward as their nominees, but normally the folks who get to determine who the nominee is are the voters in those individual states in the primaries,” Peters said in an interview. “If we look at what happened last cycle, those primary voters tended to pick highly flawed candidates, and I expect that will happen again.”     \n  \n\n      The fight for the seat occupied by Sinema has quickly emerged as the messiest affair – for both parties.    \n  \n\n      Sinema’s recent change in party identification — switching from a Democrat to an independent — poses a fresh challenge that party leaders will have to navigate, as it could set up an unpredictable three-way race. Sinema has not yet said if she will run again, but she has been raising enormous sums in preparation for a potential bid and has been meeting with strategists and advisers to map out plans for a possible campaign.    \n  \n\n      And Democratic leaders are worried that backing a fellow Democrat in the primary could end up alienating Sinema and potentially lead her to caucus with the GOP, forcing them to stay neutral for now.    \n  \n\n      “She’s a very effective legislator,” Schumer, who so far is neutral in the race, said when asked about Sinema recently.  \n  \n\n      On the GOP side, several candidates who tried — and failed — to win statewide races last cycle are also complicating that strategy, making it a key source of anxiety among many top Republicans and the Senate committees, according to Republican sources.    \n  \n\n      Those candidates include Lake and the 2020 Senate GOP nominee, Blake Masters, two of the most Trumpian candidates who lost last year. Both Lake and Masters garnered enormous support among the GOP base for leaning into 2020 election denials and the populist ideals that Trump touted throughout his presidency. Masters has discussed a potential 2024 Senate bid with several Republicans, though it’s unclear whether he will run, GOP sources say.  \n  \n\n      Lake met with the NRSC for roughly an hour in February and is expected to meet with them again in the coming weeks, sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The issue of focusing on claims of a stolen election was one point discussed at the meeting, the sources said.\n  \n\n      “The point that has been brought up, which Kari knows, is that the issue sets are different from a governor’s race. She knows you can’t run on that because it’s not something, as a senator, that you can fix,” a source close to Lake said, referencing her rhetoric around stolen elections. “The conversation was more about how the issues are different between a governor’s race and a Senate race.” \n  \n\n      Senior Republicans acknowledge that her ultimate decision on whether to enter the race could freeze out other candidates, particularly those wanting to run in the same lane, with the source close to Lake saying establishment-minded Republicans have been reaching out to her about a potential run. The source said Lake has a 200,000-plus donor list she could pull support from and believes she would have “widespread support” if she decides to run.\n  \n\n      But many in the top ranks are skeptical about her chances.    \n  \n\n      “If you take a look at the race, where Sen. Sinema is probably going to take some of the right, left and center, it’s going to make for a difficult path for a Republican in that state in any scenario,” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN. “The party there is, I think, set on Lake if she decides to run with it, but, I mean, we just have to see how well she performs.” \n  \n\n      Tillis added that, given the “three-way race dynamic,” Lake “is not going to be able to make a lot of headway there.”     \n  \n\n      Cornyn said of Lake: “Her recent track record doesn’t indicate that she would be successful. We need candidates who can broaden their appeal beyond the base and win a general.” \n  \n\n      Masters, meanwhile, has quietly reached out to some advisers about what another Senate run would look like and has spoken with some senior GOP officials about a 2024 run.\n  \n\n      Other potential GOP candidates include Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who is expected to announce a Senate run as soon as this week and is viewed favorably by some top Republicans, according to GOP sources. Abe Hamadeh, formerly the Republican nominee for Arizona attorney general, is also weighing a run. And both Lamb and Hamadeh met recently with NRSC officials, but they have not met directly with Daines, according to a source familiar with the meetings.  \n  \n\n      Two other Republicans, Jim Lamon and Karrin Taylor Robson, are also considering jumping into the race, sources familiar with the matter say. Lamon and Robson, who ran in 2022 for Senate and governor respectively, did not receive Trump’s support.     \n  \n\n      Robson recently met with the NRSC, and many within the GOP committee “like her and see her as a quality candidate,” a source familiar with the meeting said. Lamon has not yet met with the NRSC, but is expected to set up a meeting in the coming months.     \n  \n\n      Arizona’s Senate primary is not until August 6, 2024, and the filing deadline to enter is April 8, 2024 — giving them a long runway to decide whether or not to run — further complicating GOP leadership’s calculus on how to navigate the race dynamics.     \n  \n\n      “I just think we’re, we’re more likely to get people elected if they’re focused on the future, as opposed to focusing on what happened in 2020,” Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican of Utah, said when asked about a potential Lake candidacy. “I think the American people have made their judgment about the election and want to move on. So, let’s talk about the future and where we’re headed, and if we’ve got a candidate that is consumed with his or her past, it’s most likely a losing candidate.”    \n  \n\n      Caroline Wren, a senior adviser to Lake, told CNN, “There’s no doubt Kari Lake is a formidable force in the Republican party right now, but she’s still focused on her lawsuit in Arizona,” referring to her efforts to dispute her loss in the governor’s race.\n  \n\n      Rubio said that Lake could be a strong Senate candidate, despite her shortfall last year.      \n  \n\n      “She was a very competitive candidate. I think I trust the Republican voters in Arizona to pick the nominee,” Rubio said. “I don’t think Washington should be stepping in to do it.”     \n  \n\n      But Democrats believe that a Lake candidacy will only bolster their chances, even if Sinema decides to run.   \n  \n\n      Rep. Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat running for his party’s nomination in the Senate race, suggested to CNN he was praying for a Lake candidacy.    \n  \n\n      “I’m a practicing Catholic – so I have these votive candles for different things,” Gallego said. “I have a special candle for Kari Lake to jump in.”    \n  \n\n  CNN’s Morgan Rimmer and Kit Maher contributed. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Former President Donald Trump on Friday filed his personal financial disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission – offering the public a first look at his post-presidential finances.\n  \n\n      The reports, however, provide an imprecise financial picture because candidates are only required to report their assets and liabilities in broad ranges. Friday’s filing allows Trump to avoid paying a $200 late fee after missing an earlier deadline to file the report, the first of his 2024 candidacy.\n  \n\nREAD: Donald Trump's personal financial disclosure report\n\n\n      The 101-page report provided some new insights into Trump’s finances since he left office, including his social media business venture, and last year’s sale of digital trading cards known as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. \n  \n\n      The filing includes the listing of hundreds of Trump’s assets, from properties like his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to royalties from his books. \n  \n\n      Trump reported more than $5 million in income from speaking engagements, according to the financial disclosure report. \n  \n\n      The former president also reported earning between $100,001 to $1 million in income from NFTs according to the filing. \n  \n\n      Additionally, he reported that Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., an umbrella company connected to his social media venture, Truth Social, is valued between $5,000,001 and $25 million. But Trump, who owns 90% of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., reported little to no income from that asset. \n  \n\n      The filing underscores the global reach of Trump’s business interests as he campaigns for president yet again. He reported, for instance, more than $5 million in royalties from what is described as “DT Marks Oman LLC.” \n  \n\nTrump campaign says it saw surge in donations after indictment\n\n\n      The New York Times reported in November that the Trump Organization had struck a deal with a Saudi real estate company to build a Trump hotel, villa and golf course in Oman as part of a $4 billion project. \n  \n\n      A Trump campaign spokesman did not respond to questions about the filing Friday evening.\n  \n\n      Of the 16 books listed by Trump, “The Art of the Deal” – his 1987 memoir that dispensed business advice – was the biggest money-maker, netting royalties between $100,000 and $1 million, according to the disclosure. Most of the books drew royalties of less than $201. \n  \n\n      According to the filing, the majority of former first lady Melania Trump’s income comes from royalties through MKT World LLC, which she lists between $1 million to $5 million, as well as rental income from a real estate deal in Slovenia, which provides between $1,000 to $15,000 in income.  \n  \n\n      Trump reported paying off six mortgages and taking on two more on his existing properties. Two of the mortgage payoffs, for Miami and Washington properties, were loaned by Deutsche Bank – which said it would refrain from future business with Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. His Washington mortgage that was paid off was for the Old Post Office Building, which housed a Trump hotel near the White House. Trump’s company sold the lease on that property last year.\n  \n\n      Last month, Trump attorney Derek Ross wrote to the FEC, saying the former president needed “an additional 30 days” to finalize and file his report, given the “complexities of his financial holdings.”  \n  \n\n      Trump had previously sought and secured two, 45-day extensions on the filing deadline – the maximum allowed. Trump’s filing – after securing the two extensions – had been due March 15. \n  \n\n      The Federal Election Commission’s Acting General Counsel Lisa Stevenson wrote in response to Ross’ request that Trump had exhausted all of his extensions. And she warned that Trump could face a $200 fee if he didn’t turn in the report within 30 days, under the federal law governing these disclosures.  \n  \n\n      “President Trump has significant financial holdings, and we have advised the Federal Election Commission that additional time is needed to file his financial disclosure report,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in an email to CNN, when asked about the delay last month. \n  \n\n      Most presidential candidates – and White House officeholders – also release their tax returns for a more detailed picture of their finances. Trump steadfastly refused to do so during his previous candidacy and White House tenure.  \n  \n\n      Last year, House Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee released six years of Trump’s tax returns from 2015-2020, the culmination of a yearslong legal battle over their disclosure.   \n  \n\n      The thousands of pages of financial documents – which the committee sued to obtain after Trump broke decades of tradition of presidential candidates releasing their tax returns – provided the most detailed look to date at Trump’s finances, revealing that the former president paid little or no income taxes several years after claiming huge business losses before and during his presidency.  \n  \n\n      A Joint Committee on Taxation report on Trump’s tax returns showed that Trump carried forward huge net operating losses that often zeroed out his tax liabilities. Trump paid $750 in taxes in 2016 and 2017 and $0 in 2020 as he reported millions in losses.  \n  \n\n      The returns showed that Trump had business income, taxes, expenses or other financial items in nearly two-dozen countries, as well as multiple foreign bank accounts, including an account in China from 2015 to 2017.  \n  \n\n      Trump’s financial disclosure form filed in 2020 listed at least $446 million in revenue from dozens of sources, including his hotels, resorts, golf courses and royalties from books and television programming. Trump’s financial disclosure form appeared to list revenues for the Trump Organization as “income,” which is typically used to report only personal take-home pay or share of an asset – a move that gave an inflated view of Trump’s wealth. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Former President Donald Trump keeps using wildly inaccurate figures to minimize the threat of climate change.\n  \n\n      Trump, now a presidential candidate, has argued in speeches and interviews that the risk of nuclear war is a much more important issue than climate change. He is entitled to his opinion. But he has repeatedly defended that opinion by citing imaginary statistics on the extent to which sea levels are expected to rise in the future.\n  \n\n      In a Fox interview this month, Trump echoed a claim he made in his campaign launch speech in November. He said on Fox: “When I listen to people talk about global warming, that the ocean will rise, in the next 300 years, by 1/8th of an inch – and they talk about, ‘This is our problem.’ Our big problem is nuclear warming, but nobody even talks about it. The environmentalists talk about all this nonsense.” \n  \n\n      In a podcast interview that aired last week, Trump used a figure even smaller than 1/8th of an inch over 300 years: “When I see these people talking about global warming, where the ocean will rise by 1/100th of an inch over the next 350 years…” \n  \n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims about sea levels are not remotely close to accurate. As the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has noted, the global sea level is currently rising at about 1/8th of an inch per year. In other words, the sea level rise Trump claimed people say will happen over 300 years is actually happening annually. NOAA says that, along the United States coastline in particular, sea level rise is expected to average a total of 10 to 12 inches between 2020 and 2050 alone. \n\n\n      That means NOAA expects an average increase in the US sea level that is 80 to 96 times bigger, over just 30 years, than the “1/8th of an inch” increase Trump suggested has been projected over 300 years. And NOAA’s estimate for US sea level rise over those 30 years is 1,000 to 1,200 times bigger than the “1/100th of an inch” figure Trump cited on the podcast last week for the next 350 years.\n  \n\nGary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary sciences who studies sea level rise, said in an email on Friday that Trump’s claims “can only be described as totally out of touch with reality…simply untrue.” He said Trump “has no idea what he is talking about.”\n  \n\n      Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations. For the US, sea levels are expected to rise particularly fast for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast – and Florida, which is bordered by both coasts, is expected to be affected more severely than many other coastal states. Trump’s claims about sea levels are highly inaccurate for his own home in Florida, the Mar-a-Lago resort on the Atlantic.\n  \n\n      Even in an optimistic scenario where global warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, the sea level near Mar-a-Lago is expected to rise nearly 3 feet by 2150 relative to 1995-2014 levels, according to a NASA projection tool that incorporates the latest climate science. That’s a projected increase of more than 3,500 times Trump’s “1/100th of an inch” figure, and in about half the time period – roughly 150 years versus Trump’s 300 years. \n  \n\n      Sea levels could rise much faster with more warming. Under a scenario with high emissions and a rapid collapse of ice sheets, NOAA says the contiguous US could see a sea level increase of 7.2 feet over 2000 levels by 2100 and an increase of 13 feet over 2000 levels by 2150. \n  \n\n      Trump has for years dishonestly dismissed the existence and impact of climate change. In a speech at a conservative conference last year, after saying that “the oceans may rise, over the next 300 years, 1/100th of an inch,” he joked, “Giving you slightly more seafront property.”\n  \n\n      In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland – rendering some communities uninhabitable and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of flooding, making hurricanes more destructive, and damaging infrastructure and ecosystems.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      It’s a different week but a similar story for Donald Trump.\n  \n\n      He’s due back in New York on Thursday under a dark legal cloud to answer more questions about his conduct, a week after becoming the first ex-president to be charged with a crime.\n  \n\n      Last week, Trump pleaded not guilty in a case arising from a hush money payment to an adult film star. He’s expected back in the city where he made his name to give a deposition in a separate civil case alleging that he and three of his adult children falsified Trump Organization accounts in a years-long fraud to enrich themselves.\n  \n\n      The two trips encapsulate the converging legal battles that are putting Trump’s time-honored strategy of delay, denial and distraction to its ultimate test.\n  \n\n      The barrage of legal jeopardy doesn’t mean the ex-president is guilty of anything, and he denies wrongdoing in all cases. But it shows that at least Trump – as well as some of those most involved in amplifying his election fraud misinformation after the 2020 election – may be forced to answer for conduct that critics and political opponents have long argued flies in the face of the law, truth and decency.\n  \n\n      It’s possible that the charmed life of the real estate magnate turned reality star turned twice-impeached ex-president may be about to be doused in a cold shower of reality. But Trump is not walking into this dark legal storm meekly. His lawyers fired off new filings and digressions in some of the many cases against him Wednesday, and his allies in the Republican House majority stepped up their efforts to shield him.\n  \n\n      Trump’s lawyers, for example, are asking a judge to delay for one month a civil sexual assault and defamation trial brought by former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, which was slated to begin later this month. His team wants a “cooling off period” following his indictment in the Manhattan case for falsifying business records, arguing that jurors would have those charges “top of mind” when they are called.\n  \n\n      Remarkably, these cases may not be the most serious legal jeopardy bearing down on Trump. He is waiting to find out whether he will be indicted in special counsel probes into his hoarding of classified documents and his behavior leading up to the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. And Trump and supporters involved in the democracy-damaging chicanery following the 2020 election still don’t know whether they will be charged in yet another investigation, this one in Georgia, over his attempt to find just enough votes to try to steal President Joe Biden’s victory in the swing state.\n  \n\n      This is an extraordinary tsunami of credible legal threats to confront one person – let alone someone who was once charged by the Constitution with taking “care that the laws be faithfully executed.” The incredible personal and legal pressure on Trump also poses the question of how he can fully concentrate on the all-consuming effort of running a presidential campaign. Being a defendant in multiple legal cases would mean that court dates, not campaign rallies, dictate much of his schedule.\n  \n\nJudge in Dominion case sanctions Fox for withholding evidence, plans to appoint special master to probe possible misconduct\n\n\n      Trump is not alone in staring down a legal imbroglio.\n  \n\n      Thursday is the first day of jury selection in the Dominion Voting Systems’ $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which could feature testimony from Fox anchors and media baron Rupert Murdoch. Dominion, a voting technology company, says the right-wing network trashed its reputation when its top talent promoted false claims that Dominion machines rigged the 2020 election. In the run-up to the trial, Fox has faced severe embarrassment following the release of text messages that showed some of its most famous opinion hosts scoffing at Trump’s claims, which they nevertheless promoted on air, and top executives warning that telling the truth to viewers would be bad for business. Dominion must prove that Fox acted with actual malice in promoting the falsehoods in order to win damages from the network.\n  \n\n      The case, which CNN legal analyst Eli Honig this week predicted would turn into a “full-blown legal and journalistic disaster” for Fox, took another ominous turn on Wednesday when a judge sanctioned the conservative network over the possible withholding of evidence and said he plans to appoint an outside attorney to investigate.\n  \n\n      “I’m very uncomfortable right now,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said on Wednesday after rebuking the network’s lawyers from the bench. Fox denies wrongdoing in both the issue raised by the judge and in the broader case, arguing that it was simply covering Trump’s allegations of election fraud and that a verdict against it would infringe press freedom.\n  \n\n      Trump’s trip back to New York on Thursday follows a deposition he gave Attorney General Letitia James’ office last year before the suit against him and the Trump Organization was filed, in which he cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to more than 400 questions. His position is more nuanced now since in a civil case, if a defendant takes the Fifth, a jury can make an “adverse inference” against them.\n  \n\n      The former president reacted to the suit filed by James, a Democrat, in the same way that he responds to any accusation of wrongdoing – by accusing legal authorities of pursuing a political vendetta against him.\n  \n\n      Similarly, he has responded to his indictment in Manhattan by accusing District Attorney Alvin Bragg, also a Democrat, of seeking to prevent him reclaiming the White House in his 2024 campaign. In an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox on Tuesday, the ex-president said he would never drop out of the presidential race if he was convicted and claimed his foes were using the “old Soviet process” to convict him of crimes he said he didn’t commit.\n  \n\nTrump asks to delay sexual assault trial following historic indictment\n\n\n      Trump’s classic tactic of trying to delay accountability was also on display Wednesday when lawyer Joe Tacopina asked the judge overseeing the Carroll lawsuit to delay the trial until the end of May. Tacopina warned that intense media coverage of Trump’s arraignment last week could taint the jury pool. “To be sure, President Trump is a persistent subject of media coverage. But the present situation is unique because, as stated above, the recent coverage pertains to alleged sexual misconduct, the same issue at the heart of this litigation,” Tacopina wrote to Judge Lewis Kaplan.\n  \n\n      But Carroll’s lawyers said Trump’s request had no merit and a delay of a month would do nothing to cool press interest in the trial. “And in all events, Trump is exceptionally ill-suited to complain about fairness when he has instigated (and sought to benefit from) so much of the very coverage about which he now complains,” Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, wrote to the judge.\n  \n\n      Trump has denied sexually assaulting Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. She first sued Trump for defamation in 2019 after he denied the rape and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book.\n  \n\n      The ex-president, who has long been known for using the court system to pursue his personal and political goals, unveiled yet another legal front on Wednesday by announcing a $500 million lawsuit alleging that Michel Cohen breached his contract as his former personal attorney.\n  \n\n      The move raised immediate suspicions that Trump was seeking to intimidate or silence Cohen, who testified before the Manhattan grand jury and is likely to be a key witness in Bragg’s prosecution. Prosecutors allege that Trump tried to hide hush money payments to adult actress Stormy Daniels to avoid harming his 2016 campaign.\n  \n\n      CNN legal analyst Karen Friedman Agnifilo said on “Erin Burnett OutFront” on Wednesday that Trump appeared to be trying to get around the judge’s warning that the matter should not be tried in the court of public opinion. “The timing is suspect, the claims are suspect, and I also don’t logistically see how this is going to work,” Agnifilo, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said.\n  \n\n      House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, meanwhile, stepped up his apparent effort to thwart Bragg’s investigation – or at least to discredit Bragg in the eyes of voters – in the latest move from Trump’s allies to fight the case in public before it ever reaches the courtroom. The Ohio Republican announced a slate of witnesses for a field hearing of his committee in New York on Monday as he attempts to make a case that Bragg went after Trump for political reasons.\n  \n\n      Accountability may be coming for Trump. But he’s going to do everything he can to thwart it. Anything else would be out of character.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

                "content": "\n      In a first-of-its-kind criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump, Manhattan prosecutors are accusing Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign.\n  \n\n      The criminal charges stem from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush money payments, made during the 2016 campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.  \n  \n\n      Trump “repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election,” the charging documents unsealed Tuesday allege.\n  \n\nREAD: Trump indictment and statement of facts related to hush money payment \n\n\n      Each criminal charge Trump is facing relates to a specific entry among the business records of the Trump Organization.\n  \n\n      Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges on Tuesday.\n  \n\n      Here’s a breakdown of the charges and evidence presented against Trump in the indictment and court documents:\n  \n\n      A major question was whether Bragg would charge Trump with a felony and how he would go about doing so, since falsifying business records – the count that Trump is charged with 34 times – is a misdemeanor unless prosecutors can prove that the records were falsified with the intent to commit or conceal another crime.\n  \n\n      The new statement of facts only hints at the approach Bragg is taking, but the prosecutor laid out his legal theory more clearly during a news conference after the arraignment. \n  \n\n      Bragg said the business records were falsified in 2017 with the intent of concealing criminal conduct connected to the 2016 campaign. He referenced a New York state law that makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means.\n  \n\n      Bragg is not charging Trump with a violation of election law or a conspiracy related to that alleged campaign-related conduct. The indictment says for all 34 counts that Trump had the “intent to defraud and intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof.” \n  \n\n      The statement of facts explains that Trump allegedly orchestrated an “unlawful” scheme with others to “influence the 2016 presidential election” and that other participants in the scheme have admitted to “committing illegal conduct in connection with the scheme.\n  \n\n      Specifically, the statement of facts references the guilty plea by ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen in the federal campaign finance case that was prosecuted in 2018 and the admissions of AMI – the publisher of National Inquirer – in the non-prosecution agreement it reached in the federal investigation. \n  \n\n      The statement of facts cautions in a footnote that it “does not contain all facts relevant to the charged conduct.” \n  \n\n      In describing the alleged election influence scheme, the charging documents go into detail about how the plan to silence women accusing Trump of extramarital affairs allegedly came about. \n  \n\n      According to the charging documents, the editor-in-chief and the CEO of the National Enquirer approached then-Trump lawye Cohen shortly after the “Access Hollywood” tape became public in October 2016, and told Cohen that adult-film actress Stormy Daniels was claiming she had an affair with Trump. \n  \n\n      The charging documents say Cohen negotiated a hush-money payment with Daniels to “secure [Daniels’] silence and prevent disclosure of the damaging information in the final weeks before the presidential election.”  \n  \n\n      Trump allegedly hid the reimbursement payments to Cohen by marking monthly checks for “legal services,” according to the statement of facts, in a deal the two worked out in the Oval Office.\n  \n\n      Trump personally signed checks reimbursing Cohen, prosecutors allege, including for the $130,000 he paid Daniels in exchange for her signature on a non-disclosure agreement. The plan was for reimbursements to made to Cohen that would amount to $420,000 total, with an extra 180,000 thrown in to cover his income tax exposure and then a $60,000 bonus on top of that, the charging documents allege.\n  \n\n      Trump also allegedly agreed to pay Cohen $35,000 monthly for one year.\n  \n\n      “In early February 2017, the Defendant and Lawyer A met in the Oval Office at the White House and confirmed this repayment arrangement,” the statement of facts says. \n  \n\n      Many of these specific facts have been public for years. Cohen publicly revealed one of the $35,000 checks while testifying to Congress in 2019 in an effort to corroborate his story that Trump played a role in coordinating and orchestrating the payment to Daniels. \n  \n\n      Prosecutors say checks were cut monthly – including some coming directly from Trump’s bank account – to Cohen. They allege these were disguised as attorney payments when they were not.\n  \n\n      “Each check was processed by the Trump Organization, and each check was disguised as a payment for legal services rendered in a given month of 2017 pursuant to a retainer agreement,” prosecutors wrote in the statement of facts accompanying the indictment. \n  \n\n      “The payment records, kept and maintained by the Trump Organization, were false New York business records. In truth, there was no retainer agreement, and Lawyer A was not being paid for legal services rendered in 2017,” it adds, referring to Cohen.\n  \n\n      The way that the payments were falsely memorialized in the company’s records, according to prosecutors, is the backbone of the crime that Trump is actually being charged with. \n  \n\n      According to the legal theory Bragg is pushing, what makes the falsified business records a felony is an underlying federal campaign finance crime that Trump is accused of trying to conceal. The district attorney also claims that state election law was violated with the scheme.\n  \n\n      The statement of facts points to court filings in the federal investigation into the hush-money payments to  assert that the participants in the alleged illegal scheme, including Cohen, have admitted the payoffs to the two women were unlawful.\n  \n\n      In late 2018, American Media, Inc. also entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the Southern District of New York’s US attorney’s office relating to paying Karen McDougal, another woman who allegedly had an affair with Trump – which he denies – for her story about Trump, the statement of facts says. \n  \n\n      Detailing AMI’s role in the alleged scheme may also help prosecutors convince a jury at trial that the payoff gambits were aimed protecting Trump’s electoral chances, contradicting how the payments were allegedly recorded in business records.\n  \n\n      AMI told authorities they never intended to publish McDougal’s story and made the payment to McDougal so that she “did not publicize damaging allegations” about Trump “before the 2016 presidential election and thereby influence that election,” the statement of facts says.  \n  \n\n      The statement of facts also cites Cohen’s federal guilty plea, which said Cohen worked at the direction of Trump to arrange payment for the two women, McDougal and Daniels, to stop stories that could be harmful to Trump. \n  \n\n      The documents also includes the allegation that Trump instructed Cohen to delay making the payments to Daniels until after the election because after that point, it would not matter if her story came out and they could perhaps avoid making the payments altogether. Prosecutors may seek to use that alleged instruction to justify the felony charges by arguing that the purpose of the payments were to secretly influence the presidential campaign, in violation of election law.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Three thousand miles away from his New York legal drama, Donald Trump secured a substantial victory in another court. \n  \n\n      The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the former president in his effort to recoup additional legal fees from adult film star Stormy Daniels, who had filed and lost a defamation suit against him.\n  \n\n      Daniels was ordered to pay Trump’s attorneys just over $120,000 in legal fees. That’s on top of the more than $500,000 in court-ordered payments to Trump attorneys she’s already been ordered to pay. \n  \n\n      The civil litigation is officially unrelated to Trump’s arrest and charges filed against him in New York, but both involved Daniels, who was paid $130,000 in hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about an affair. (Trump denies the affair.)\n  \n\n      Daniels had sued Trump in 2018 after he called an allegation by Daniels that an unknown man threatened her in a parking lot to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump a “total con job” in a tweet. \n  \n\nDismissing the lawsuit in October 2018, District Judge S. James Otero said Trump’s statement was protected by the First Amendment. \n  \n\n      “The Court agrees with Mr. Trump’s argument because the tweet in question constitutes ‘rhetorical hyperbole’ normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United States. The First Amendment protects this type of rhetorical statement,” Otero wrote at the time. \n  \n\n      Otero later ordered Daniels to pay roughly $293,000 in legal fees. She was also ordered to pay $245,000 in fees after losing another appeal.  \n  \n\n      Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, had asked the appeals court to knock down another award. The court declined her request. \n  \n\n      “Clifford’s argument that the fee request is unreasonable and excessive is not well-founded,” the 9th Circuit filing stated.\n  \n\n      “Trump’s attorneys reasonably spent the requested 183.35 hours preparing a motion to dismiss, a reply to the opposition to the motion, two extension motions, the answering brief, and the fee application,” it added. \n  \n\n      Trump attorney Harmeet Dhillon celebrated the ruling in a tweet Tuesday, saying: “Congratulations to President Trump on this final attorney fee victory in his favor this morning. Collectively, our firm obtained over $600,000 in attorney fee awards in his favor in the meritless litigation initiated by Stormy Daniels.” \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

                "content": "\n      The civil battery and defamation trial for columnist E. Jean Carroll against former President Donald Trump is set to begin Tuesday. \n  \n\n      Carroll alleges Trump forcibly raped and groped her in a Manhattan luxury department store dressing room in the mid 1990’s. Trump denies the charges and has said Carroll is “not my type.” \n  \n\n      Unlike his dramatic courtroom appearance in New York state court earlier this month, Trump is unlikely to appear in the Manhattan federal courtroom, his lawyers have said, unless he is called to testify in Carroll’s case or opts to take the stand in his own defense. Because it is a civil case, he is not required to appear.\n  \n\n      Jury selection begins Tuesday and the trial is expected to last up to two weeks.  \n  \n\nNotable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023\n\n\n      Trump is not being criminally prosecuted on Carroll’s rape allegations. Carroll did not specify an amount in her civil lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court but is seeking monetary damages and a retraction of an October 2022 social media statement Trump made about Carroll. \n  \n\n      Here’s what to know:  \n  \n\n      Nearly four years after Carroll first went public with the allegations in 2019, a jury is expected to be empaneled. Federal District Judge Lewis Kaplan is expected to winnow down a pool of about 100 prospective jurors.  \n  \n\n      The attorneys have asked the judge to quiz the jury pool on issues like their potential biases and their knowledge of Carroll, Trump and the pending legal matters Trump is facing in unrelated cases like his recent indictment in New York County criminal court.  \n  \n\n      The jury will remain anonymous to the public and the attorneys, the judge ruled. The decision was in part influenced by Trump’s threats to the state Supreme Court judge overseeing his criminal case in New York.  \n  \n\n      Attorneys for Carroll and Trump could give opening statements late in the day Tuesday.  \n  \n\n      Carroll filed the suit last November under New York’s 2022 Adult Survivors Act that opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitations.  \n  \n\n      The former Elle columnist first came forward with her story in June of 2019 publishing an excerpt from her book “What Do We Need Men For” in New York Magazine ahead of the book release.  \n  \n\n      “And, while I am not supposed to say it, I will. This woman is not my type,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. \n  \n\n      “In the meantime, and for the record, E. Jean Carroll is not telling the truth, is a woman who I had nothing to do with, didn’t know, and would have no interest in knowing her if I ever had the chance. Now all I have to do is go through years more of legal nonsense in order to clear my name of her and her lawyer’s phony attacks on me. This can only happen to ‘Trump’!” \n  \n\n      The lawsuit argues the denial of Carroll’s allegations is defamatory and caused her emotional, reputational and professional harm.        \n  \n\n      Carroll’s account of the alleged rape after encountering Trump at Bergdorf Goodman in the fall of 1995 or spring of 1996 is detailed in the lawsuit.    \n  \n\n      She recalled telling Trump she was 52 at time. Both are now in their 70’s. \n  \n\n      She helped Trump shop for “a girl” when he recognized her leaving the store, Carroll says. \n  \n\n      “Hey, you’re that advice lady!” he said to her, according to the lawsuit. “Hey, you’re that real estate tycoon!” she replied.  \n  \n\n      Trump steered what started out as light-hearted shopping to the lingerie department where he suggested Carroll try on a bodysuit, the suit alleges. Carroll says Trump then guided her toward a dressing room, where she jokingly suggested he try on the lingerie.  \n  \n\n      Once in the dressing room Trump “lunged at Carroll, pushing her against the wall, bumping her head quite badly, and putting his mouth on her lips,” according to the lawsuit. With Carroll fighting back, Trump pushed her against the wall again, “jammed his hand under her coatdress and pulled down her tights,” the lawsuit says.  \n  \n\n      “Trump opened his overcoat and unzipped his pants. Trump then pushed his fingers around Carroll’s genitals and forced his penis inside of her,” the suit alleges.  \n  \n\n      Carroll eventually pushed him off with her knee and ran out of the dressing room to exit the store, according to the lawsuit.  \n  \n\n      The former president categorically denies that the interaction and assault ever happened.  \n  \n\n      After Carroll went public, Trump said he “never met this person.” \n  \n\n      Trump’s counsel has made several legal attempts to dismiss the litigation with Carroll and once tried to countersue her, alleging Carroll violated New York’s anti-SLAPP law prohibiting frivolous defamation lawsuits – a claim rejected by Judge Kaplan.\n  \n\n      Carroll first sued Trump for defamation in 2019 for statements he made denying the allegations at the time. That case has been paused pending further litigation about how to handle the case because Trump was president when he made the statements at issue in the lawsuit.  \n  \n\n      Attorneys for the career advice columnist have indicated that Carroll will likely take the stand to tell her account to the jury.   \n  \n\n      Trump, however, is unlikely to appear in the Manhattan federal courtroom, his lawyers have said, unless he is called to testify in Carroll’s case or opts to take the stand in his own defense.  \n  \n\n      Trump’s attorney told the court that Trump wanted to attend the trial but claimed it would be a burden on the city and court staff to accommodate him given the security protection he receives. \n  \n\n      Judge Kaplan has not decided whether he’ll instruct the jury about Trump’s absence from the defense table. \n  \n\n      Jurors are expected to see at least some parts of Trump’s video deposition taken last October for this case. Excerpts of the deposition were previously unsealed in court filings ahead of the trial. \n  \n\n      Carroll’s lead attorney, Roberta Kaplan, a civil attorney who’s represented women in high-profile sexual assault litigation like victims of Jeffrey Epstein, indicated that her team can put on Carroll’s case without Trump making an appearance. (Carroll’s attorney and the judge are not related.) \n  \n\n      Two longtime friends of Carroll, who’ve confirmed that she confided in them soon after the alleged incident more than two decades ago, can testify to corroborate Carroll’s story, Judge Kaplan ruled over objections from Trump’s legal team.  \n  \n\n      Carroll has said when she confided in journalist Lisa Birnbach, her friend told her she’d been raped and should report the incident to the police at the time.  \n  \n\n      When she told former local TV anchor Carol Martin a day or so later, Martin warned Carroll that she was no match for Trump’s army of lawyers and said it was best to keep it to herself – which is ultimately what Carroll did until 2019, she says.  \n  \n\nTrump accuser: He touched me 'wherever he could find a landing spot'\n\n\n      Two other women who allege Trump physically forced himself on them can also testify about their allegations, the judge ruled.   \n  \n\nJessica Leeds has alleged that Trump, seated next to her on a plane, groped her on a flight from Texas to New York in 1979. Leeds, who first came forward during the 2016 presidential election, said in a deposition for this case that Trump acknowledged remembering her from the plane when she saw him at an event sometime after the alleged incident.  \n  \n\nPeople Magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff similarly alleges that Trump groped her and tried to forcibly kiss her in 2005 when Stoynoff was at Mar-a-Lago to interview Trump and a then-pregnant Melania Trump on their first wedding anniversary. \n  \n\n      Trump denies both incidents ever happened. \n  \n\n      Attorneys for Carroll are expected to show the jury a black and white photo of Trump where he is interacting with several people, including with his then-wife Ivana, Carroll and her then-husband.  \n  \n\n      A transcript of his October 2022 deposition revealed that Trump mistook Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples when he reviewed the photo during the deposition.  \n  \n\n      “I don’t know who – it’s Marla,” Trump said when shown the photo. “That’s Marla, yeah. That’s my wife,” he says when asked to clarify. \n  \n\n      Trump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, then interjected and said “no, that’s Carroll,” according to the transcript. \n  \n\n      Carroll’s lawyers have said the photo proves Trump had in fact met Carroll and she could be his “type.” \n  \n\n      Trump’s comments on the 2016 campaign trail denying allegations from Leeds and Stoynoff can also be admitted as evidence, the judge ruled.  \n  \n\n      Like Carroll, Trump has asserted that the allegations are false and implausible in part because the women aren’t attractive or his ‘type.’ \n  \n\n      Jurors may also hear the controversial “Access Hollywood” tape on which Trump can be heard telling show host Billy Bush how he would use his stardom to aggressively come on to women. \n  \n\n      Trump has chalked up his graphic language on the tape, which first surfaced during his 2016 Presidential election campaign, as “locker room talk” that wasn’t actually true.  \n  \n\n      Judge Kaplan ruled that a jury could reasonably find that Trump admitted in the Access Hollywood Tape “that he in fact has had contact with women’s genitalia in the past without their consent, or that he has attempted to do so,” and the jury may view accounts from Leeds and Stoynoff as support for that argument.  \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n      News helicopters hovered as a string of SUVs zipped down the FDR Drive in Manhattan. A crowd of journalists, supporters and onlookers waited at the Manhattan Criminal Court, surrounded by police officers. All were awaiting the arrival of the defendant.  \n  \n\n      The atmosphere might have been unusual — the thousands of New Yorkers who pass through the court each year seldom draw much attention — but what happened inside was an ordinary process: an accused person turned himself in, was arrested and fingerprinted and appeared before a judge to hear the charges and enter a plea.  \n  \n\n      The spectacle outside — and the one that will surely evolve as former president Donald Trump attempts to seize control of the story of his indictment — might tempt observers to see Trump’s arrest as an extraordinary event. And it is historic: no former president has ever been indicted. But the story told in the images of Trump walking through the scuffed halls of the court building, is a story of accountability under the law – extraordinary only in its ordinariness.  \n  \n\n      The first photos of Trump in the courtroom underscore that message: he was seated at a courtroom table, flanked by lawyers and four uniformed police officers, contained and constrained in ways he seldom has been since entering electoral politics eight years ago.  \n  \n\nCNN reporter describes Trump's mood inside courtroom\n\n\n      As he entered the court, he delivered first a wave and then raised a fist to his supporters. But any sign of defiance had vanished by the time of his arraignment and not-guilty plea. \n  \n\n      Beneath the familiar swoop of dyed-blond hair and thick foundation, his expression was grim and reserved. For the moment, he was just another defendant, dependent on a judge to determine his next move. And while Trump will work hard in the coming hours and days to offer a different reading of those images — and media outlets will be tempted to help him out by focusing on the spectacle — they depict not a departure from regular order, but rather its return. \n  \n\n      Trump’s time in elected office was one marked by impunity. The man who once bragged he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and walk away scot-free seemed to have understood the truth of his status well before most Americans. While journalists and analysts explained how Trump flouted laws like the Emoluments Clause and the Presidential Records Act, Trump simply continued on, sensing that, as a resident of the White House, he was someone who the law could not touch. And it didn’t.  \n  \n\n      Efforts to hold Trump accountable ran instead through political processes like impeachment and congressional hearings, processes that could reveal bad acts but not redress them – certainly not while Republicans in Congress refused to play a role.  \n  \n\n      The first and second impeachments involved necessary debate and public exposure, but each started with a foregone conclusion: that the vast majority of Republicans would never turn on Trump. The January 6 Committee played out along similar lines, with Republican leaders refusing from the start to engage in a process that might end with a referral of charges against the former president. \n  \n\n      Trump worked hard in each of those instances to degrade and invalidate the process, to treat them as illegitimate in order to blunt the findings. He is now doing the same with his indictment, arguing it is a witch hunt and a political prosecution meant to deny him a second term in office.  \n  \n\nOpinion: Trump's visit to Waco is a provocation of historic significance\n\n\n      At his opening campaign rally in Waco, Texas, last week — a place legendary on the far-right as a symbol of deadly government overreach — Trump lashed out at the indictment. “The thugs and criminals who are corrupting our justice system will be defeated, discredited and totally disgraced,” he said, vowing to destroy the “deep state” if he is re-elected. \n  \n\n      Since news of the indictments broke, he has been working with his team to decide how best to present himself, according to the New York Times. Should he wave to those gathered or stay silent? Should he smile or stay solemn? Should he avoid a mugshot, or ask for one? \n  \n\n      These were questions for both lawyers and campaign aides, since Trump clearly plans to leverage the images as part of his 2024 presidential bid. Already his campaign is promoting t-shirts with digitally-created mugshots, and his campaign emails burst with warnings that after “they” come for the president, they’re coming for his voters next.\n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      “They can try to stop me all they want with threats, indictments and even arrests,” he wrote in an April 1 email, “but they can NEVER crush the spirits of 74 million patriots who want to make our country great again!”  \n  \n\n      That escalating rhetoric, along with the unprecedented nature of Trump’s arrest, creates the perfect conditions for observers to give into the hype, to focus on the spectacle and all that goes with it. But it is this emergence of process of accountability, with all its paperwork and rules and routines repeated hundreds of times a day in places like the Manhattan Criminal Court, that is extraordinary. As images roll out showing that ultimately mundane process, it’s worth attending to how remarkably quotidian they are, and how necessary the opportunity for a small dose of justice really is.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "Live\nRussia's war in Ukraine\nHighlights\nMet Gala 2023\nBy Aditi Sangal, Adrienne Vogt, Mike Hayes, Tori B. Powell, Kaanita Iyer, Amir Vera and Maureen Chowdhury, CNN\nOur live coverage of former President Donald Trump's historic indictment and felony charges has moved here.  \nAnalysis from CNN's Stephen Collinson\n\n\nThere were two big things to fear before Tuesday’s momentous first criminal arraignment of an ex-president of the United States.\nThe first was that while Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case might cite solid evidence of alleged wrongdoing by Donald Trump, his legal theory might prove too vague, complex and seem like too much of a throwback to a 7-year-old election to be an easy sell to the public.\nThe other was that Trump would respond with such fury and incitement that he would rip even deeper divides in a nation estranged by his aberrant presidency and stoke new turmoil that could further damage vital political and judicial institutions.\nBoth of those worst-of-all-worlds scenarios came true on a day that Trump described as “SURREAL” in a social media post sent as he motorcaded to court to turn himself in. \nThe result is that another grim and even tragic chapter may lie ahead for a country that is still far from working through the fallout from Trump’s single term as it girds for yet another bitter election.\nRead the full analysis here.\nFrom CNN's Lauren del Valle\n\n\nFollowing former President Donald Trump's arraignment, prosecutors said they expect to produce the bulk of the discovery in the next 65 days. \nTrump's team has until August 8 to file any motions and the prosecution will respond by September 19. Judge Juan Merchan said he will rule on the motions at the next in-person hearing, scheduled for December 4.\nTrump attorney Jim Trusty said Tuesday he expects “robust” motions to challenge the case and hopes they can succeed in stopping the case. \nIf not, Trusty said he expects Trump’s attorneys will “figure out if there’s a way to try to push this earlier” than the December 4 hearing.\nFrom CNN's Jeremy Herb, Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in Manhattan criminal court Tuesday afternoon.\nTrump surrendered and was placed under arrest Tuesday before he was arraigned in a historic and unprecedented court appearance, in which the former president heard the charges against him for the first time. While the arraignment was routine, the case is now poised to linger over Trump’s 2024 candidacy as he fights the charges both in court and in public.\nWhat prosecutors are alleging: Prosecutors alleged that Trump sought to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election through a hush money scheme with payments made to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump. He has denied the affairs.\nTrump was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, including an illegal payment of $130,000 that was ordered by the defendant to suppress the negative information that would hurt his campaign, prosecutors alleged.\nTrump “repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election,” according to the charging documents.\nTrump's Tuesday night speech: After the arraignment, Trump immediately flew back to Florida. He held an event with his supporters Tuesday evening at his Mar-a-Lago resort, where Trump made his public case against the indictment and previewed how he intends to fight against the charges politically as he runs again for the White House in 2024.\nWhile he was warned by Judge Juan Merchan during Tuesday’s arraignment not to make comments that could “jeopardize the rule of law” or create civil unrest, Trump railed later that evening against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the judge himself.\n“I never thought anything like this could happen in America, never thought it could happen. The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,” Trump said.\n“It’s an insult to our country,” he added.\nThe next dates to watch for: Trump's team has until August 8 to file any motions and the prosecution will respond by September 19. Judge Juan Merchan said he will rule on the motions at the next in-person hearing, scheduled for December 4.\nRead more. \n \nFrom CNN's Kristen Holmes\nFormer President Trump was “upset” after “an emotional day” a source close to the former president tells CNN. \n“Who wouldn’t want to be with people that adore him after that?” the source said of the former president.\nTrump ended the day eating dinner on the patio of his Mar-a-Lago club, surrounded by club members, family and some of his staunchest supporters on the hill, including Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, another source present told CNN. \nFollowing uncharacteristically brief remarks after his arraignment, Trump was seen DJ-ing from a laptop amid his supporters, and at one point chatting with far-right figure Roger Stone. \n“It was a long day,” a third source said of Tuesday's historic events. \nFrom CNN's Daniel Dale \n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump made a speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday night after he was arraigned in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records —  and delivered a barrage of false claims that have been previously debunked. \nTrump pleaded not guilty to all the charges Tuesday. \nThe former president was repeatedly inaccurate when he pivoted to the subject of the federal investigation into his handling of official governments. He also repeated some of his favorite falsehoods on a variety of other subjects. \nHere is a fact check of some of Trump's claims: \nGeorge Soros and the district attorney: As he has on social media in the last month, Trump invoked liberal billionaire donor George Soros while criticizing District Attorney Alvin Bragg in his speech on Tuesday night — claiming that Bragg is a \"radical left, George Soros-backed prosecutor.\" \nFacts First: This needs context. Soros did not make any donations to Bragg's 2021 election campaign, and a Soros spokesperson, Michael Vachon, told CNN that the two men have never once communicated in any way; there is no evidence that Soros had any role in Bragg's decision to prosecute Trump. However, Soros, a longtime supporter of Democratic district attorney candidates who favor criminal justice reform, did support Bragg's election campaign indirectly: he was a major donor to a liberal political action committee, Color of Change PAC, that says it spent just over $500,000 on an independent expenditure effort in support of Bragg's candidacy.  \nFormer presidents' handling of documents after leaving the White House: Defending his handling of government documents, which is the subject of an ongoing federal investigation, Trump repeated his false claim that that several other former presidents took documents with them upon leaving the White House. \nTrump claimed in his Tuesday speech that \"openly taking boxes of documents and mostly clothing and other things to my home\" is something \"which President Obama has done.\" He continued, \"The Bushes have done. Jimmy Carter's done. Ronald Reagan is done. Everybody's done.\"\nFacts First: This is false, as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) itself pointed out in a statement last year; there is no evidence that previous presidents did anything like what Trump did after the Presidential Records Act took effect in 1981 (beginning with the Reagan administration). In reality, NARA was granted custody of the presidential records of former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and both George Bushes as soon as these presidents left office, as required by the Presidential Records Act, and it was NARA, not those presidents, that moved those documents to temporary archival facilities — facilities managed by NARA. \nNARA said in an October statement that it gained physical and legal custody of Obama, Reagan, H.W. Bush and W. Bush's records, as well of those of President Bill Clinton, \"when those presidents left office.\" It said of the temporary facilities to which the documents were moved: \"All such temporary facilities met strict archival and security standards, and have been managed and staffed exclusively by NARA employees. Reports that indicate or imply that those Presidential records were in the possession of the former Presidents or their representatives, after they left office, or that the records were housed in substandard conditions, are false and misleading.\" \nInflation: Trump claimed that the United States has \"an economy that has been crippled by the biggest inflation we have seen in more than 60 years.\" \nFacts First: Trump's \"60 years\" claim is an exaggeration, though the inflation rate does remain high by historical standards.  \nLast June, the year-over-year inflation rate hit its highest level since late 1981, 9.1%. But about 41 years does not round to \"60 years,\" much less \"more than 60 years\". The actual highest year-over-year inflation rate for the last 60 years is 14.8% (in early 1980), far higher than mid-2022 levels. More importantly, year-over-year inflation has now declined for eight straight months, hitting 6% in February 2023 — not even close to the 60-year high. \nThis Trump claim is an example of how the former president tends to increase his exaggerated figures over time. At a campaign rally in Texas in late March, he claimed — also incorrectly — that the country had the highest inflation in \"50 years.\" \nRead more here. \nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale \n\n\nFormer president Donald Trump claimed Tuesday night that the Presidential Records Act requires prolonged negotiations over the return of documents — while denouncing the August federal search of his Mar-a-Lago property. \nHe said: “Just so everyone knows, I come under what's known as the Presidential Records Act, which was designed and approved by Congress long ago just for this reason. Under the act, I’m supposed to negotiate with NARA, the National Archives and Records Administration.” \nHe went on to disparage NARA.  \nFacts First: Trump’s claim is false. The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from his administration. Nothing in the law says there should be a negotiation between a former president and NARA over a former president’s return of presidential documents -- much less that there should have been a monthslong battle after NARA first contacted Trump’s team in 2021 to try to get some of the records that had not been handed over at the end of his presidency. \nJason R. Baron, former director of litigation at NARA, told CNN in an email last week (when we fact-checked a similar false claim by Trump): “The former President is simply wrong as a matter of law. As of noon on January 20, 2021, when President Biden took office, all presidential records of the Trump Administration came into the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States. Full stop. That means no presidential records ever should have been transferred to Mar-a-Lago, and there was no further talking or negotiating to be had.” \nTimothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, New York University professor and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, described Trump’s claim as “nonsense” and said the former president’s description of the Presidential Records Act is “a matter of fantasy,” concocted to allow Trump to “pretend that he’s a victim.” \nThe law, Naftali said in an interview last week, makes clear that documents Trump had at Mar-a-Lago are presidential records that legally belong to the public and are legally required to be in NARA’s custody. The law provides “no room for debates and discussions between presidential advisers and the National Archives at the end a presidency” about such records, Naftali said. \nFrom CNN’s Daniel Dale\nFormer President Donald Trump repeated one of his familiar lies about the 2020 election he lost, in his Tuesday night speech from his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. \nTrump claimed that there were “millions of votes illegally stuffed into ballot boxes, and all caught on government cameras.” \nFrom CNN's Jack Forrest\nFormer Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who first began the investigation into former President Donald Trump's alleged role in hush-money payments but chose not to indict, said current DA Alvin Bragg \"has done the work necessary to bring this case forward.\" \nVance told CNN's Jake Tapper Tuesday night, \"I think there are factual allegations that at least myself personally, I cannot recall that we were aware of,\" in response to whether Bragg had collected any new evidence since Vance left DA's office. \nHe added, \"There's no doubt that district attorney Bragg has dug deep, believes in this case, and I think we need to have confidence that he has done the work necessary to bring this case forward.\"\nThe former DA also commented on Trump's speech following his arraignment, calling his attacks on Bragg, as well as the judge presiding over the case, and their families, \"legally risky.\"\nVance said Trump could run up against obstruction charges specific to the New York code which make it illegal to obstruct government functions through threats or intimidation. \n\"If that were to happen in a superseding indictment, it could turn a perceptually weak indictment on technical violations of law into something a jury would understand and be much more concerned about and elevate the strength of the overall indictment against the president,\" he said.\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience."

                "content": "\n      Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, was released from jail on Wednesday after serving roughly four months for his role in a decade-long tax fraud scheme. \n  \n\n      Weisselberg, who remains loyal to former President Donald Trump, was sentenced in January to five months in jail as part of a plea deal, which involved him pleading guilty to 15 felonies and testifying against his former employer at the criminal tax fraud trial. \n  \n\n      Two Trump Organization entities were convicted and fined the maximum penalty of $1.6 million. \n  \n\n      Weisselberg began working for Trump’s father Fred roughly 50 years ago and then became a close adviser to Trump seeing his business through bankruptcies and revivals. Weisselberg remained on leave from the company even after he was criminally charged. He was let go from the company and given a “generous” severance deal in January, a person familiar with the arrangement previously told CNN. \n  \n\n      Prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorneys office have pressured Weisselberg in the past and again more recently with criminal charges to try to gain his cooperation in investigations involving Trump. \n  \n\nNotable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023\n\n\n      Even during the trial of the Trump entities, Weisselberg did not implicate Trump or any of his family members. \n  \n\n      Weisselberg recently changed attorneys, and the reasons are in dispute. \n  \n\n      Nicholas Gravante, who represented Weisselberg until recently, told CNN, “Anyone who truly knows Allen feels sorry that he had to go through this. I hope he can now retire in peace, spend time with his wonderful family, and leave the circus in the rearview mirror. It was my honor and privilege to have represented him. He’s a true gentleman.”\n  \n\n      Trump, who was indicted last month for allegedly falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment, has recently blamed the district attorney for targeting Weisselberg. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n  \n\n  CNN’s Julian Cummings contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Kyrsten Sinema. \n  \n\n      Lamb is the first prominent Republican to formally join the primary, which could escalate further with the entry of Kari Lake, the far-right unsuccessful 2022 Arizona gubernatorial nominee who has also teased a bid. \n  \n\n      Over the last few years, Lamb has worked to raise his profile with the GOP base, making regular appearances on Fox News, focusing on immigration and criticizing Covid-19 vaccine requirements.  \n  \n\n      Lamb also has a checkered history as a proponent of false claims about election integrity. He supported former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, defended rioters at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and vowed to investigate voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. However, at a congressional hearing earlier this year, Lamb admitted he had seen “zero evidence” of fraud that could have impacted the outcome in 2020. \n  \n\n      Ahead of a potentially crowded and contentious primary, Lamb is viewed favorably by some top Republicans, GOP sources have told CNN. Meanwhile, Abe Hamadeh, formerly the Republican nominee for Arizona attorney general, is also weighing a run. Both Lamb and Hamadeh met recently with National Republican Senatorial Committee officials. \n  \n\n      Two other Republicans, Jim Lamon and Karrin Taylor Robson – who ran in 2022 for Senate and governor respectively – are also considering jumping into the race, sources familiar with the matter say. \n  \n\n      Trump’s influence looms large. His endorsement of Blake Masters in the 2022 race proved influential, and Lake has been loudly auditioning for his support as she’s traveled the country following her loss in the gubernatorial race.  \n  \n\n      In addition, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego announced in January that he will also challenge Sinema in 2024 after she declared she was leaving the Democratic Party late last year to register as an independent. \n  \n\n      Gallego’s declaration sets up a three-way race in a battleground state that’s been the epicenter of election controversies in consecutive cycles. The race will also put pressure on national Democrats, who are attempting to retain a two-seat US Senate majority while defending several vulnerable incumbents across the country.\n  \n\n      Sinema has not yet announced her plans for 2024, but The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that her team is preparing for reelection.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Former President Donald Trump raised a combined $18.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 through his joint fundraising committee and his campaign – and saw a spike in donations after being indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on March 30 – according to new figures provided by his campaign.  \n  \n\n      The campaign told CNN it also raised $15.4 million in the two weeks after charges were filed against the former president, showing how much his supporters have rallied around Trump after learning of the indictment. \n  \n\n      The Trump campaign said the fundraising figures suggest his legal woes have benefited him both politically and financially – at least in the short term – and energized his base as he continues to campaign for his third shot at the presidency.  \n  \n\n      Politico first reported Trump’s first quarter fundraising numbers. \n  \n\nTrump files personal financial disclosure report\n\n\n      Trump’s campaign previously said on March 31 that it had raised $4 million in the 24 hours since his indictment was first announced. The former president has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records. \n  \n\n      During the first quarter, from January 1 to March 31, Trump received a total of 541,971 donations, according to the figures provided by his campaign. The average donation was roughly $34.  \n  \n\n      Comparatively, Trump received 312,564 donations in the two weeks after charges were filed against the former president, beginning on March 30, with the average donation totaling roughly $49.  \n  \n\n      Prior to the indictment, the former president was bringing in roughly $168,000 per day between January 1 to March 30. It’s unclear whether the boost the Trump campaign says it received since his indictment will continue into the second quarter. \n  \n\n      The former president has been raising money for his 2024 presidential bid through both his campaign and his political action committee, Save America PAC. Filings Saturday night with the Federal Election Commission show that $14.4 million of the first-quarter haul went to Trump’s main campaign account.\n  \n\n      The figure lags behind the $30 million he raised during the first quarter of the 2020 election cycle, when he still occupied the Oval Office.\n  \n\n      In all, the Trump campaign spent $3.5 million in the first quarter and had $13.9 million in cash on hand as of March 31. \n  \n\n      More than $727,000 of his campaign dollars during the three-month period funded payroll, filings show. A little more than $488,000 went to TAG Air Inc. – the Trump-owned company that operates his airplanes.\n  \n\n      Other Republicans who have announced their 2024 candidacies include Nikki Haley, a former United Nations ambassador and ex-South Carolina governor, whose campaign has said she collected $11 million in the six weeks since she launched her bid on February 15. But the filings show she raised less than that, and her campaign appears to have double-counted money routed among various committees. In all, Haley raised $8.3 million across three committees connected to her campaign.\n  \n\n       Another South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Tim Scott – who announced a presidential exploratory committee on Wednesday, after the end of the first quarter – reported Saturday that he had nearly $22 million remaining in his Senate campaign account as of March 31. That’s money Scott could transfer directly into a presidential campaign account.\n  \n\n      Biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who declared his bid for the GOP nomination in February, loaned his campaign $10.25 million and raised about $1.2 million from contributors through March 31. He had nearly $9.4 million in cash on hand at the end of the quarter, his FEC filing shows.\n  \n\nDeSantis, on cusp of presidential campaign, defies national abortion sentiments with signing of six-week ban \n\n\n      Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to launch a 2024 GOP presidential bid, has built a sizable war chest through his state-level fundraising committee. Friends of Ron DeSantis has more than $85 million remaining in its coffers, recent state records show. \n  \n\n      He faces restrictions on the use of that money for a presidential bid, but it could potentially be transferred to another committee backing his candidacy. \n  \n\n      Already, a pro-DeSantis super PAC, Never Back Down, which launched in March, has announced that it had raised $30 million as of early April. The group debuted its first national TV ad Sunday, taking direct aim at the former president.\n  \n\n      “Donald Trump is being attacked by a Democrat prosecutor in New York, so why is he spending millions attacking the Republican governor of Florida?” the ad said. “What happened to Donald Trump?” The one-time buy on Fox will be followed by a seven-figure national ad buy beginning Monday, according to a source familiar with the super PAC’s plans. \n  \n\n      Details on Trump’s fundraising after the first quarter ended on March 31 won’t be disclosed to regulators for several months.\n  \n\n      On Friday, the former president filed his personal financial disclosure report with the FEC – offering the public a first look at his post-presidential finances. The 101-page report provided some new insights into Trump’s finances since he left office, including his social media business venture, and last year’s sale of digital trading cards known as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Sixty percent of Americans approve of the indictment of former President Donald Trump, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS following the news that a New York grand jury voted to charge him in connection with hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. About three-quarters of Americans say politics played at least some role in the decision to indict Trump, including 52% who said it played a major role. \n  \n\n      Independents largely line up in support of the indictment – 62% approve of it and 38% disapprove. Democrats are near universal in their support for the indictment (94% approve, including 71% who strongly approve of the indictment), with Republicans less unified in opposition (79% disapprove, with 54% strongly disapproving). \n  \n\nIn between rounds of golf, Trump considers how best to use indictment as 2024 rallying cry \n\n\n      While views on the indictment are split along party lines, the poll finds that majorities across major demographic divides all approve of the decision to indict the former president. That includes gender (62% of women, 58% of men), racial and ethnic groups (82% of Black adults, 71% of Hispanic adults, 51% of White adults), generational lines (69% under age 35; 62% age 35-49; 53% age 50-64; 54% 65 or older) and educational levels (68% with college degrees, 56% with some college or less). \n  \n\n      CNN has reported that the former president faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud, but the indictment remains under seal and the charges were not publicly known at the time of the survey. The investigation relates to a $130,000 payment made by Trump’s then-personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Daniels in late October 2016, days before the 2016 presidential election, to silence her from going public about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affair. At issue in the investigation is the payment made to Daniels and the Trump Organization’s reimbursement to Cohen.\n  \n\n      A scant 10% overall see Trump as blameless regarding payments made to Daniels, but Americans are divided about whether his actions were illegal or merely unethical. About 4 in 10 say he acted illegally (37%), 33% unethically but not illegally, and another 20% say they aren’t sure. Only 8% of political independents say Trump did nothing wrong, and among the rest, they are mostly on board with the indictment even if they aren’t already convinced Trump did something illegal.\n  \n\n      Even among those who disapprove of the indictment, the perception that Trump’s actions were questionable is fairly widespread, with about half in that group saying Trump did something wrong regarding payments to Daniels (52%). Far more in that group say he acted unethically rather than illegally, though (49% unethical, 3% illegal), with the remainder split between thinking he did nothing wrong (23%) and not being sure (24%). Among those who approve of the decision to indict Trump, just 1% say his actions were not wrong at all, while 59% call them illegal and 23% unethical. \n  \n\n      The survey suggests that the indictment has not had a major effect on views of Trump personally. The poll finds his favorability rating at 34% favorable to 58% unfavorable, similar to his standing in a January CNN poll, in which 32% held a favorable view of the former president and 63% an unfavorable one. Among Republicans, 72% hold a favorable view in the new poll, similar to the 68% who felt that way in January. \n  \n\n      Most Americans (76%) believe politics played at least some role in the decision to indict Trump, who is both a former president and current candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. About half (52%) see it as having played “a major role” in the decision, while around a quarter say it played a minor role and 14% no role at all. Another 10% are unsure if politics was a factor in the grand jury’s vote. \n  \n\n      Nearly all Republicans, 93%, see the indictment as politically motivated, including 83% who say politics played a major role. Among independents, 52% say politics played a major role; that drops to 25% among Democrats.\n  \n\n      Americans are split over the effect the indictment may have on democracy. About three in 10 say the decision strengthens US democracy (31%) and an identical share say it weakens democracy (31%). Roughly a quarter say it has no effect on democracy (23%) and 15% are unsure. Republicans broadly see it as weakening democracy (62% say so). Two-thirds of those who disapprove of the indictment say the same (67%) as do 54% of those who believe politics played a major role in the decision to indict. Most Democrats see it as strengthening democracy (55%). Among those who approve of the indictment, 48% say it strengthens democracy and 30% that it has no effect on it. \n  \n\n      The poll also finds that Americans split over the investigation launched by House Republicans into Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s handling of the Trump case, with 38% saying they disapprove of the GOP’s efforts to investigate him, 35% saying they approve, and a sizable 27% unsure how they feel about the investigation. \n  \n\n      More than 9 in 10 Americans have heard at least a little about the historic indictment, with 51% saying they’ve heard a lot. Democrats are most apt to be highly tuned in, with 56% saying they’ve heard a lot about the charges, compared with 48% each among independents and Republicans.\n  \n\n      The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS on March 31 and April 1 among a random national sample of 1,048 adults surveyed by text message after being recruited using probability-based methods. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups.\n  \n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the correct percentage of independents who approve of the indictment of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\n  Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\n\n      This week brought an unprecedented event in American history – the first criminal charges against a former president. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unveiled an indictment against Donald Trump with 34 counts of violating New York State’s law against maintaining false books and records by concealing hush money payments to his alleged former mistress, adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. \n\n\n      In an accompanying statement of facts, Bragg alleges the payments were intended to benefit Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign by avoiding a damaging scandal.

In the wake of the “Access Hollywood” tape of Trump proclaiming that he was free to sexually assault women, which threatened his candidacy, another disgraceful revelation could have altered the outcome of that contest – and American history.\n  \n\n      The alleged election misconduct also seems like it might have been a gateway drug for Trump’s even more extensive attempted electoral tampering with respect to the 2020 contest.\n  \n\n      Nevertheless, the indictment has been greeted by decidedly mixed reactions – including from some who are usually critical of the former president. They have argued that the hush money case appears too political, it’s too thorny legally and should have been brought by federal authorities – or not at all. \n\n\n      There are a number of important critiques of the case in the furor and they are worthy of consideration. But ultimately, they are all wrong.\n  \n\n      Bragg’s case is a strong one and should not be resisted merely because it involves a controversial political figure. Nothing is tougher than a legal imbroglio involving a president – we know that better than anyone, from our experience with the investigations of President Richard Nixon and Trump himself. But that same experience has only reinforced what our experience with rogue presidents has taught us is the bedrock of our democracy: No president is above the law.\n  \n\nOpinion: The images of Trump's historic day tell a surprising story\n\n\n      Perhaps the single most repeated critique of the case by Trump and his allies is that the DA – a Democrat – is motivated by politics. Trump’s lawyer Jim Trusty has argued for example that because Bragg discussed his experience investigating Trump during his campaign, this prosecution is “not the rule of law” and represents “an upside-down world of criminal justice where we don’t follow evidence.”\n  \n\n      That’s nonsense. There’s no good reason to exempt Trump from prosecution when his former lawyer Michael Cohen went to prison for his role in surreptitiously moving these funds to benefit the campaign, as have others for similar conduct. \n\n\n      The violation for falsifying books and records is a clear one: These were alleged hush-money payments by Trump and his entities that they are accused of falsely entering into their records as legal fees. \n\n\n      New York law allows the elevation of the misdemeanor to a felony if the cover-up was to hide or advance another crime. Here, Bragg charges, the hush money was hidden to obscure violations of campaign finance laws that prohibit payments of this kind. Bragg also indicates that there was a plan to make false statements to tax authorities.\n  \n\n      Among the other criticisms of pursuing a felony charge is that the campaign finance theory failed in a similar criminal prosecution of 2008 Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards for alleged campaign-related payments to his mistress. \n  \n\n      In fact, making various types of concealed payments to benefit a campaign is commonly prosecuted – ergo Cohen’s plea. There was nothing legally wrong with the prosecution theory in the Edwards case or the judge would not have allowed it to go to the jury. Instead, the jury found that the proof was not sufficient in that particular case.\n  \n\n      In this one, Bragg has the benefit of an inside cooperator in the form of Cohen, whose account is corroborated by substantial reported documentary, testimonial evidence and even a tape of a conversation with Trump.\n  \n\nOpinion: The problem with Trump's indictment\n\n\nSome complain that too much time has passed to bring charges now, about six years after the payments were made. Our answer is that it takes time to charge a president, or even a former one. Years were lost while charges could not be brought federally under Justice Department guidance prohibiting charging a sitting president – and while Trump repeatedly litigated the New York state investigation up to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n      It’s hard to fault Bragg for lost time when his predecessor, Cy Vance, stated this weekend that federal prosecutors had told him and his team to “stand down” during the Trump administration because their own investigation was underway.\n  \n\n      Vance’s interview rebuts another of the critiques we’ve heard from Trump and others: that this case had been passed on by others. Vance refuted that in his interview, confirming that he and his team “had not finished that work [the investigation]” and that to move forward was “ultimately…District Attorney Bragg’s decision.”\n  \n\n      To those who say the hush money charges are a poor substitute for addressing Trump’s attempted coup or alleged financial wrongdoing, we note that the investigations of all that are hardly over. Charges are possible for the 2020 misconduct in Georgia and perhaps by special counsel Jack Smith federally.\n  \n\n      Significantly, if others have minimized these hush money charges, Trump has not. He has treated them with a level of alarm and dangerous rhetoric we have not seen from him since the runup to Jan. 6. \n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      On Truth Social, Trump has repeatedly called for action from his supporters, writing, “PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!” among other reckless declarations.  He greeted news of the charges by stating, “This is Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history.” \n  \n\n      The charges are no such thing, but Trump’s strong reaction shows he understands their seriousness. Bragg did the right thing when he said he would not be deterred by such intimidation – just as he was right to bring this case.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "content": "\n      Former President Donald Trump once backed raising the retirement age to 70 and called for privatizing Social Security which he called a “Ponzi scheme” – two positions he has hammered Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for supporting as a former member of Congress and congressional candidate.  \n  \n\n      Trump made the comments in 2000 in a book he authored called “The America We Deserve,” when he was considering a third-party run for president as a member of the Reform Party.  \n  \n\nTrump, his campaign and a supporting PAC have repeatedly cited votes from DeSantis in Congress for nonbinding budget resolutions that would have raised the retirement age to 70.  \n  \n\n      The campaign has also cited DeSantis’ praise of Paul Ryan’s budget plans during his 2012 congressional campaign with comments that expressed support for privatizing Social Security and Medicare – but a CNN KFile review found Trump himself also once praised Ryan on Medicare, along with the 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, without praising their specific policy proposal, which called for similar changes to Ryan’s plan. \n  \n\n      In his book, Trump lamented big cuts the program would need without changes, and said he would consider privatization. \n  \n\n      “The truth is undeniable, the workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme,” Trump wrote. “The solution to the Great Social Security Crisis couldn’t be more obvious: Allow every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds.” \n  \n\n      “We can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy,” he wrote. \n  \n\n      The Trump campaign told CNN that that as president, Trump “has consistently showed he would always protect entitlements. In contrast, DeSantis has consistently voted to cut entitlements, and has long advocated raising the age of retirement.”  \n  \n\n      “When President Trump was elected and went to Washington, DC, he saw just how corrupt and dangerous Paul Ryan was and prevented his disastrous ideas like cutting Social Security and Medicare from coming to fruition,” Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesman, said in the statement.  \n  \n\n      In a 1999 interview with NBC News’ Tim Russert prior to the release of the book, Trump said he didn’t want to privatize the program but was open to it. \n  \n\n      “I don’t like the idea of privatizing Social Security. I think it’s certainly something that could be looked at. I think the Social Security system is in very serious trouble. Obviously, it’s always going to be backed by the country, but I think it’s in very serious trouble. I would look at privatization. I don’t know that that’s the answer.” \n  \n\n      “But you’d open to it?,” asked Russert . \n  \n\n      “I’m open to it, yes,” he said.  \n  \n\n      By the 2010s, Trump broke from what was then Republican orthodoxy and said GOP efforts to change entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare would be political disasters and blasted the Ryan budget – urging Romney not to embrace it as the nominee of the party. \n  \n\n      But in the 2012 presidential race, he defended the Republican ticket – and praised Ryan – saying the pair would save the program. Their plan at the time was similar to the Ryan proposals that Trump has hammered DeSantis for supporting.  \n  \n\n      “I think Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will save Medicare,” Trump said to Fox News in August 2012. I know they will. And people are starting to understand it. They’re going to be very happy with what’s going on, but they’re going to be very, very unhappy if Obama gets in. I think actually if Obama gets in, and if Obamacare isn’t ended, I really think Medicare will be a thing of the past.” \n  \n\n      In October 2012, Trump again strongly praised Ryan on Medicare in an appearance on Fox News – saying his qualm with Ryan’s budget was he should’ve waited until after the election to make his plans public. \n  \n\n      “I certainly think it probably would’ve been more appropriate to have waited,” Trump told Sean Hannity. “But I like the energy he brings. I like a lot of the things he’s saying. He’s smart. He truly understands what’s going on with the 17 trillion and the budgets and everything else.  \n  \n\n      “And I think he’s very strongly in favor of – I know for a fact that he’s gonna save Medicare. The other side’s gonna destroy Medicare. He’s going to save Medicare. And as we know it right now – not with big deductions and big cuts and big, he’s going to save Medicare. Medicare cannot exist with the other side in office. It will explode.” \n  \n\n      As a candidate for the Republican nomination in 2016, Trump reiterated his approach to not touching entitlements, saying his administration would not change either program. \n  \n\n      A budget from Trump’s White House did eventually call for reducing spending on Medicare, according to the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, but those reductions would largely affect doctors and hospitals. At the same time, in an interview he later walked back, Trump said cuts to entitlements would eventually be on the table. \n  \n\n      “At some point they will be,” Trump said in January 2020 in an interview with CNBC, comments that made their way into a response ad last week from a super PAC supporting Ron DeSantis in a potential bid for the White House.  \n  \n\n      Asked by CNBC whether he was willing “to do some of the things that you said you wouldn’t do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare,” Trump said: “We’re going to look.” \n  \n\n      In another interview in 2020, which he again walked back, Trump said he’d be cutting entitlements.  \n  \n\n      When a Fox News host noted that trimming the national debt would require cutting entitlement programs, Trump responded that it would be happening along with economic growth. \n  \n\n      “Oh, we’ll be cutting, but we’re also going to have growth like you’ve never had before,” Trump said. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

The indictment was filed under seal and the charges are not yet public. Trump’s attorney said the former president will “absolutely” voluntarily surrender to New York law enforcement and plans to file “substantial” legal challenges.\n  \n\n      And voters in Chicago will go to the polls to elect a new mayor. Incumbent Lori Lightfoot lost her bid for a second term in February after failing to make one of two runoff spots.

A handful of Republicans have entered the 2024 race so far, though Trump’s biggest potential rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, is still weighing a possible campaign. Trump’s campaign and political allies have continued to ramp up their attacks on DeSantis as the former president has racked up congressional endorsements, including from Florida Republicans who routinely work with DeSantis.\n  \n\n      But the former president is running to retake the White House at the same time that he’s been indicted in New York and faces additional legal peril in Washington and Georgia.\n  \n\n      Trump pleaded not guilty last month to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in Manhattan, in a case stemming from hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign to women claiming extramarital affairs with Trump, which he has denied.\n  \n\n      The former president is also under scrutiny by special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading a pair of investigations – one into the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and the other on the handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence. And Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis plans to announce charges this summer from the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\n  \n\n      Trump has said that he is running for president regardless of the criminal charges he may face. He’s disparaged all of the investigations as politically motivated witch hunts. \n  \n\n      The former president is also being sued by former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, who alleges that Trump sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s and subsequently defamed her after she went public about the incident. Trump has also denied Carroll’s allegations.\n  \n\n      Trump has refused to acknowledge that he lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden, continuing to falsely claim that the election was stolen from him, even as Trump’s rivals – and some of his allies – have urged the Republican Party to move on from 2020.\n  \n\n      The town hall will stream live for pay TV subscribers via CNN.com and CNN OTT and mobile apps under “TV Channels,” or CNNgo where available. The town hall will also be available On Demand beginning Thursday, May 11 to pay TV subscribers via CNN.com, CNN apps, and Cable Operator Platforms.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with new timing details on the town hall.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nEditor’s Note: Adapted from “NINE BLACK ROBES: Inside the Supreme Court’s Drive to the Right and Its Historic Consequences,” by Joan Biskupic, published by William Morrow.\n\n\n      Some Supreme Court justices thought Donald Trump was setting them up. Two days after the official swearing-in of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in October 2018, the president arranged a televised ceremony at the White House and invited all the justices.    \n  \n\n      Justices had declined to attend similar White House events under previous presidents, resisting the optics that would conflict with separation of powers. This time, they especially worried about being used for political purposes and were concerned that an appearance by the full contingent of sitting justices could look like an endorsement of the president.\n  \n\n      In the end, their concerns were justified. Most of the justices sat stone-faced, disturbed by what Trump said during the event and by being unwitting participants in a political exercise.\n  \n\n      Trump had a way of ensnarling the court in politics, fomenting rhetoric of personal destruction and conspiracy, all the while generating challenges to the rule of law.   \n  \n\n      Even today at this historic moment, as the ex-president faces criminal charges in Manhattan, one of Trump’s first responses involved attacking the judge who will preside over his initial proceedings. Trump’s terms of aggrievement and personal affront (“HATES ME”) were familiar.   \n  \n\n      Trump wrote in a social media post Friday on Truth Social: “The Judge ‘assigned’ to my Witch Hunt Case, a ‘Case’ that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME. His name is Juan Manuel Marchan, was hand picked by Bragg & the Prosecutors, & is the same person who ‘railroaded’ my 75 year old former CFO, Allen Weisselberg, to take a ‘plea’ deal (Plead GUILTY, even if you are not, 90 DAYS, fight us in Court, 10 years (life!) in jail.”   \n  \n\n      During Trump’s term as president, the Supreme Court justices navigated challenges to his administration’s policies, his attempts to block various investigations and, finally, his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Chief Justice John Roberts presided over Trump’s first impeachment trial, in 2020.  \n  \n\n      Trump’s presidency further propelled the judiciary into a new era of polarization, through his actions, plus the forceful influence of his appointees, seen most strikingly in last June’s reversal of nearly a half century of women’s abortion rights.   \n  \n\n      Trump’s choice of Kavanaugh for his second Supreme Court appointment triggered an enormous political fight that had not ended with his Senate confirmation. News networks still buzzed that October with coverage of the Senate hearings, especially Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her while a teenager and Kavanaugh’s denial.   \n  \n\n      Some of the justices later privately revealed that they found the hearings too painful to watch. The sessions stirred their own anxieties from their time in the witness chair, and even those who found Ford credible shuddered at the public thrashing of Kavanaugh. They knew he was destined to join their ranks and already felt some institutional allegiance.    \n  \n\n      Wary of Trump’s invitation after the contentious hearings, Roberts quietly sought reassurance from the White House counsel’s office that the October 8 ceremonial swearing-in would not be overtly political. \n  \n\nA secret deal between Justices John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy on gay rights and what it means today \n\n\n      With his fears calmed, Roberts and the associate justices went to the White House for the evening event. As the cameras flashed, they took their front-row seats in the East Room. Jane Roberts sat behind her husband. At her side were the other spouses: Ginni Thomas, Joanna Breyer, Martha-Ann Alito and Louise Gorsuch.   \n  \n\n      Trump immediately highlighted the rare attendance of the full Supreme Court: “Joining us for tonight’s ceremony is every sitting Supreme Court justice.”   \n  \n\n      He announced their names, individually, like blue ribbons he had just won: “Chief Justice Roberts. Thank you. Justice Thomas. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg. Thank you. Justice Breyer. Thank you, justice. Justice Alito. Thank you. Justice Sotomayor. Thank you. Justice Kagan. Thank you. And Justice Gorsuch.” The audience applauded.   \n  \n\n      What came next shattered the decorum of a judicial ceremony.     \n  \n\n      “I would like to begin tonight’s proceeding differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude,” Trump said. “On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception.   \n  \n\n      “What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process,” Trump continued. “[In] our country, a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. And with that, I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.”     \n  \n\n      But that was not true. There had been no trial, nor even much of an investigation into Ford’s accusations. But as with so many of Trump’s assertions, the truth did not matter to him or to a certain number of his supporters.      \n  \n\n      Some justices confided later that they were sorry they had gone.   \n  \n\n      Justice Clarence Thomas, however, was conspicuously enthusiastic, applauding heartily after Kavanaugh spoke. A Department of Justice spokeswoman, speaking on Fox News, later described Thomas as “the life of the party” at the Kavanaugh event. \n  \n\n      Two years later, when Trump hosted a swearing-in for Justice Amy Coney Barrett immediately after her Senate confirmation, Thomas was the only justice present. Thomas administered the constitutional oath in the televised ceremony; the next day she took the judicial oath at the Supreme Court.\n  \n\n      That night at the White House when Kavanaugh stepped to the lectern, the new justice began his remarks by singling out Roberts.     \n  \n\n      “I’m honored to serve on a Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice John Roberts,” Kavanaugh said. “Chief Justice Roberts is a principled, independent and inspiring leader for the American judiciary. As a country, we are fortunate to have John Roberts as chief justice of the United States.”   \n  \n\nHow Ginsburg's death and Kavanaugh's maneuvering shaped the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade and abortion rights\n\n\n      The move showed that the two justices had established an early alliance at the high court. (A few weeks later Roberts would favorably cite Kavanaugh in a speech, for the ideal of judicial neutrality: “As our newest colleague put it, we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation.”)  \n  \n\n      Roberts and Kavanaugh had been friends, first working together in the Department of Justice during President George H.W. Bush’s tenure (1989-1993). Their social circles overlapped, too, through their membership in a Chevy Chase club and poker games among DC’s legal elite. \n  \n\n      Trump had already made his feelings about Roberts clear as he vilified those who did not act or rule the way he wanted, such as in June 2012 when the chief justice voted to uphold the Obamacare health insurance law. Then known mainly for his New York real estate ventures and reality TV shows, Trump posted on Twitter after the ruling: “Wow, the Supreme Court passed @ObamaCare. I guess @JusticeRoberts wanted to be part of Georgetown society more than anyone knew.”  \n  \n\n      The chief justice resisted speaking out against Trump when he became president. Roberts also sought to avoid decisions that divided 5-4 and reinforced Trump’s partisan ways.   \n  \n\n      The sole time Roberts went public to counter Trump came – perhaps fittingly – when Trump railed against a federal judge in a way that struck at the heart of Roberts’ assertions of judicial neutrality. The episode marked an extraordinary clash between the heads of two branches of government. \n  \n\n      In November 2018, Trump disparaged a US district judge who had ruled against his administration’s policy regarding asylum-seekers at the southern border. “This was an Obama judge, and I’ll tell you what, it’s not going to happen like this anymore,” Trump said of US District Judge Jon Tigar as he spoke to reporters outside the White House. “We will win that case in the Supreme Court of the United States.” \n  \n\n      Roberts responded with a rare statement issued by the Supreme Court that began: “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”   \n  \n\nWhy Chief Justice John Roberts spoke out\n\n\n      Trump fired back on Twitter immediately: “Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have ‘Obama judges,’ and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.”   \n  \n\n      Roberts let Trump have the last word, resisting any further provocation. He never again directly addressed a Trump attack on the judiciary. \n  \n\n      The intemperate Trump has continually tried to pull judges into the political muck with him.     \n  \n\n      His fixation was evident early. During his presidential campaign in 2016, he tried to disparage US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was then hearing a Trump University fraud case in San Diego, as “a Mexican” judge who was unlikely to give him a fair shake.   \n  \n\n      As Trump intensified his dismissive comments about Curiel and sowed other doubts about his regard for the rule of law, the justices declined to comment on his candidacy, with one exception: Ruth Bader Ginsburg.     \n  \n\n      During an interview in July 2016, Ginsburg, surprised that Trump had become the Republican presidential nominee, told me, “He is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.” Trump fired back, saying she should leave the bench: “Her mind is shot – resign!”   \n  \n\n      Ginsburg soon afterward expressed regret for her remarks, which were criticized across the ideological divide as improper for a jurist.  \n  \n\n      Once he became president, Trump continued to openly disdain the judiciary. He constantly tweeted about the justices, alternately viewing the Supreme Court as his savior or tormentor. “See you in the Supreme Court!” he crowed in 2017 when he lost an immigration case before lower court judges. A few years later, when the high court majority turned against his administration on a series of issues, Trump tweeted, “Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn’t like me?”   \n  \n\n      The court, led by Roberts with a slim 5-4 conservative majority, did become increasingly skeptical of Trump administration policies. In spring 2019, Roberts pulled back on an initial vote for Trump’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. Roberts’ switched vote sealed the 5-4 ruling against the plan that immigrant rights groups feared would diminish Latino completion of the important decennial census questionnaire.   \n  \n\nRELATED: How John Roberts killed the census citizenship question\n\n\n      After the ruling, Trump notably declared he would not give up the fight. “I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census,” he said in one tweet, following it later with a post that, “We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question.” But Trump soon had to retreat. There was no time to write a new justification for the citizenship question and defend it in court.  \n  \n\n      The following year, Roberts quietly brokered strong majorities against Trump as the president was trying to keep his personal tax and other financial records from the Manhattan district attorney and, separately, committees of the US House of Representatives. These two cases represented the most direct separation-of-powers battles with Trump during his presidency.  \n  \n\n      The pair of disputes traced to business activities Trump had engaged in before becoming president. New York prosecutors were seeking nearly a decade’s worth of documents related to possible fraud committed by the Trump Organization and Trump himself, including whether he had, when a candidate, directed “hush money” to women who claimed to have had affairs with him. Trump has denied the women’s claims. (This New York financial investigation helped lead to Trump’s current charges.) \n  \n\n      Separately, committees of the House of Representatives, led by Democrats in 2020, were trying to obtain Trump’s accounting and banking records as they developed ethics legislation to tighten money-laundering prohibitions.  \n  \n\n      Both disputes, Trump v. Vance and Trump v. Mazars, initially produced splintered, narrow votes among the justices as they privately discussed the cases. Over two months, however, Roberts coaxed and compromised behind the scenes for two 7-2 decisions against Trump’s arguments as he tried to keep his records secret.      \n  \n\n      Roberts had wanted to lift the issues beyond Trump and show the kind of court unity the justices were able to attain in past separation-of-powers battles, for example with Richard Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1997. Also lurking in the background was the chief justice’s effort to distance the court from the most polarizing president in modern history.  \n  \n\n      As the turmoil continued, Roberts presided over Trump’s first impeachment trial (and acquittal) in the Senate, which arose from Trump’s 2019 apparent bargaining over military aid to Ukraine and a request to President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Ukrainian activities of Joe Biden, whom Trump faced in the 2020 election. \n  \n\n      Roberts declined to preside during Trump’s second impeachment trial, in 2021, when Trump had just left office and faced charges related to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.  \n  \n\n      The Supreme Court continued to confront Trump post-presidency. In January 2022, the justices rejected Trump’s attempt to block the release of presidential records to a congressional committee investigating the siege of the Capitol. Only Thomas publicly dissented as the majority brushed away Trump’s effort to prevent the National Archives from turning over the documents to a US House select committee.  \n  \n\n      Trump’s East Room celebration for Kavanaugh in 2018, eclipsed by so many conflicts in the nearly five years since, still epitomizes an uneasy chapter of the Roberts Court in the Trump era. As Trump tried to keep the court in his clutches, he only widened the fissures. \n  \n\n      He is out of office, but his presence looms in the judicial system and his legacy at the Supreme Court endures.  \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. \n\n\n      This could be the most consequential rematch in US history – a president who portrays himself as the champion of democracy against a former president who routinely rejects election results.\n  \n\n      Anyone fearing Donald Trump’s return and those who reject Joe Biden’s victory could agree that nothing less than the future of the republic is at stake if Biden and Trump are on the ballot in 2024. Biden explicitly made that case in his announcement video on Tuesday, saying “we still are” in a “battle for the soul of America.”\n  \n\n      So why does it feel like an unwanted movie sequel – same actors, predictable new plot twist?\n  \n\n      Biden has been a candidate on the national stage in five of the last ten presidential elections. His first and second presidential campaigns sputtered in Democratic primaries in 1988 and 2008. He ran as Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008 and 2012. After sitting out 2016, Biden returned on a mission to unseat Trump in 2020.\n  \n\n      Now the oldest-ever president, he is asking voters to put him in the White House until after his 86th birthday.\n  \n\nBiden announces reelection bid, saying battle for nation’s soul isn’t completeFollow live updatesAnalysis: Biden joins Trump in the 2024 race, with each making a historic bid for reelectionElection 2024: A consequential rematch of serial candidates\n\nBiden announces reelection bid, saying battle for nation’s soul isn’t completeFollow live updatesAnalysis: Biden joins Trump in the 2024 race, with each making a historic bid for reelectionElection 2024: A consequential rematch of serial candidates\n\n      Trump is already on his third straight election campaign. And let’s not forget he teased runs in 1988, when Biden launched his first failed bid, and also in 2000, when Trump left the GOP for a time, and in 2012, when he led the charge questioning, incorrectly, Obama’s citizenship.\n  \n\n      Candidates who run three or more times don’t often successfully become president. One successful example is Ronald Reagan, who like Biden and Trump was technically a senior citizen when he took office. Reagan won his first term on his third try. He also overcame underwater first term approval ratings to win reelection.\n  \n\n      In fact, at this point, a little over two years into their presidencies, Biden, Trump and Reagan were all hovering around 40% approval, according to data maintained by Gallup.\n  \n\n      Both Biden and Trump are, for now, primed to stay on top for their parties. CNN’s Harry Enten looks at polling data to argue this could be the most “boring” presidential primary season ever. It’ll be boring not because it’s inconsequential, but because it currently lacks much excitement.\n  \n\n      Enten notes that Biden has not yet drawn a serious challenger and Trump has routinely enjoyed a sizable lead over declared and likely challengers.\n  \n\n      Explaining the current strength of Trump’s position in the GOP field, Enten points at national and early primary state polling and Trump’s growing quiver of endorsements:\n  \n\nENTEN: For an example of someone polling like Trump is now and then losing the party nomination, you have to look at primaries involving an incumbent. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary to President Jimmy Carter, despite easily leading him in polling at this point in the cycle.\n\n\n      …\n  \n\nThis time around, Trump already has over 60 endorsements from governors and members of Congress. Since 1980, candidates with comparable collections of gubernatorial and congressional endorsements at this point in the cycle have all gone on to win their parties’ nominations.\n\n\n      Those endorsements include a majority of the House delegation from Florida, Trump’s adoptive home state and also home to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has not officially launched a presidential campaign but is generally regarded as Trump’s top competition.\n  \n\n      During a trip to Japan, DeSantis was asked about polls that show him trailing Trump.\n  \n\n      “Well, I am not a candidate, so we’ll see if and when that changes,” DeSantis told reporters.\n  \n\n      This is the dichotomy of US politics. Biden and Trump are in positions of strength in their respective primaries at the same time they generate very little excitement for the public at large.\n  \n\n      Less than 40% of registered voters even say Biden deserves reelection in CNN polling from March. That means more than 60% of registered voters said he does not deserve reelection. It would be an extremely troubling figure for Biden supporters if Trump did not inspire equal frustration for a large portion of the country.\n  \n\n      While a small majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said in in March they would prefer the Democratic Party to nominate someone other than Biden in 2024, Biden has actually improved quite a bit on this question. Last summer it was three quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters who were hoping for an alternative. In the meantime, Democrats outperformed expectations and kept control of the US Senate after November’s midterm election. It’s also worth noting that most people who said they wanted to see a Biden alternative did not have a specific idea about who that alternative should be.\n  \n\n      Trump, unlike Biden, does face serious challengers for the GOP primary. DeSantis has benefited from a large amount of media attention, but still consistently trails Trump in primary polling. \n  \n\n      CNN’s Eric Bradner and Gregory Krieg write about the difficulty Republican candidates have faced gaining traction against Trump despite his legal problems and his potential weakness in a general election campaign.\n  \n\n      From their report: Whether it’s a fear of alienating his core supporters or taking a social media drubbing, this new class of candidates – some officially in, others plotting their entry – has been careful in their remarks about Trump, largely steering clear of sharp criticism in favor of the occasional implicit jab, the kind that often fails to register with the average voter, or subtle indications of opposing policy views.\n\n\n      An exception to that rule of Republicans treading carefully around Trump is former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n  \n\n      “The reruns will be worse than the original show was,” Christie said of a Trump primary nomination during an appearance in New Hampshire last week.\n  \n\n      Trump has also gained ground in recent surveys. Fewer than 40% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters wanted to see Trump nominated back in CNN’s December poll. By March, a slim majority in CNN’s poll said Trump should get the nod.\n  \n\n      A more recent poll published Monday, from NBC News, suggests Trump’s indictment on criminal charges by the Manhattan DA doesn’t appear to have hurt him among Republicans. Among those who say they would vote in the Republican presidential primary next year, 46% say they would back Trump out of a list of seven possible candidates, 31% choose DeSantis, and 6% former Vice President Mike Pence. All other candidates tested were at 3% or less.\n  \n\n      Winning a nomination is a far different thing than winning the presidential election, however. And majorities of Americans aren’t happy with either man – 60% of the population say in the NBC poll that Trump should not run. An even larger portion, 70%, say Biden should not run.\n  \n\n      Thus, the latest edition of a presidential election featuring Biden or Trump, will frustrate most of the country even as it is shaping up to be the most likely possible scenario.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nEditor’s Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of an alleged assault.\n\n\n      Former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll took the stand Wednesday in her battery and defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump, testifying in chilling detail about the alleged sexual assault by the former president in a New York City department store.\n  \n\n      “I’m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn’t happen,” Carroll testified. “He lied and shattered my reputation and I’m here to try to get my life back.”\n  \n\n      Carroll is suing Trump for battery and defamation, alleging that he raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the spring of 1996 and then defamed her years later when she went public with the allegations. Trump has repeatedly denied her allegations.\n  \n\nJudge in E. Jean Carroll trial warns Trump about social media comments\n\n\n      On the stand, Carroll recalled being “delighted” to be shopping with Trump, thinking it’d be a great story to tell friends.\n  \n\n      “Well, it was such a funny New York scene,” Carroll said she thought at the time. “I love to give advice and here was Donald Trump asking me for advice about buying a present.”\n  \n\n      She was not at all fearful of Trump, who was friendly and very funny. “I was absolutely enchanted, I could only think of it as a scene that is such a great story,” Carroll said. \n  \n\n      The tone of their conversation was “very joshing and light” as they moved through the store.\n  \n\n      Carroll was too focused on Trump to notice anyone else once they took the escalator from the first floor, she testified. \n  \n\n      “I wasn’t looking, I was watching him and watching that I didn’t fall when the escalator hit the top.”\n  \n\n      Carroll recalled she was probably flirting with Trump the whole time before the alleged assault, not thinking it was intimate or serious. \n  \n\n      When the two made their way to the lingerie department, Carroll said the “comedy was escalating” but it never occurred to her that Trump might try to rape her. \n  \n\n      Zeroing in on a sheer gray bodysuit, Trump told Carroll to try it on, she said. She jokingly told him he should try it on instead. \n  \n\n      Carroll had no intention to try on the lingerie, she testified Wednesday, but followed Trump’s gesture into the dressing room thinking the moment could be a funny “Saturday Night Live” sketch. \n  \n\n      “I didn’t picture anything about what was about to happen,” she said Wednesday. “That open door has plagued me for years because I just walked into it, walked in.”\n  \n\n      Carroll recounted how Trump allegedly shoved her against the wall despite her struggles and eventually inserted his fingers and then his penis inside her. \n  \n\n      She recalled the pain she felt in the back of her head and her vagina. \n  \n\n      Growing emotional on the stand, Carroll took a long pause as her attorney asked what she did after Trump allegedly forced himself inside her. \n  \n\n      “When you ask me what I did in that moment,” Carroll said, stuttering through tears, “I always think – I always think of why I walked in there to get myself in that situation. But I’m proud to say I did get out, I got my knee up and pushed him back.”\n  \n\n      Carroll said Trump’s alleged assault only lasted a few minutes, and that her adrenaline didn’t give her time to be afraid.\n  \n\n      “This is going to sound strange: I was almost too frightened to think if I was afraid or not, I was stamping (my feet),” she said. “My whole reason for being alive in that moment was to get out of that room.”\n  \n\n      “It was very stupid,” Carroll said on the stand, choking up. “It changed – I know people have been through a lot worse than this but it had – it left me – it left me unable to ever have a romantic life again.”\n  \n\n      Carroll recalled lingering pain and that it took her awhile to calm down that night, though acknowledged she didn’t seek medical attention. “I was extremely rattled, I didn’t know who I was, I couldn’t believe that it happened, I couldn’t believe that it happened to me,” she said.\n  \n\n      Carroll testified that she called her friend Lisa Birnbach when she left the store because Birnbach, she said, was the funniest woman she knew.\n  \n\n      “If Lisa thought it was funny then it was not a bad thing and I didn’t completely do a stupid thing,” Carroll recalled thinking. “I had not processed it. I had not processed what was going on.”\n  \n\n      Birnbach told Carroll, who was laughing on the phone, that it wasn’t funny, that Carroll was raped and should report the assault to the police, Carroll testified.\n  \n\n      Carroll testified that they eventually agreed never to talk about it again and that she felt ashamed of what she alleged happened with Trump. “Because I was flirting with him and laughing having one of the great times and it was high comedy, it was funny and then to have it turned into that,” Carroll said.\n  \n\n      The next day at the studio where her TV show was filmed at the time, Carroll recalled seeing another friend, Carol Martin, in whome she later confided.  Agreeing that they couldn’t speak plainly at work, Carroll told Martin about the incident with Trump later that night at Martin’s home.\n  \n\n      Martin warned Carroll never to report her story or even talk about it because Trump would “bury” her with his legal team.\n  \n\n      Carroll agreed with Martin. “I was frightened of Donald Trump. I thought he would retaliate and I was ashamed. I thought it was my fault,” she said.\n  \n\n      Carroll acknowledged she is a registered Democrat and thinks Trump is “evil” and “vile” and was a terrible president, but testified that her political views have nothing to do with her pursuit of this lawsuit. \n  \n\n      “I’m not settling a political score,” Carroll said. “I’m settling a personal score because he called me a liar repeatedly and it really has decimated my reputation. I’m a journalist – the one thing I have to have is the trust of the readers.”\n  \n\n      Carroll’s attorney Michael Ferrara asked why she didn’t go public with her allegations when Trump first ran for president. \n  \n\n      “I noticed that the more women who came forward to accuse him, the better he did in the polls,” she said.\n  \n\n      Before Carroll took the stand, former Bergdorf Goodman Women’s Store Manager Cheryl Beall testified for under an hour as Carroll’s first witness in the civil trial.\n  \n\n      Beall worked at the luxury department store for a decade until about 1998, and had an office on the sixth floor adjacent to the lingerie department where Carroll has alleged Trump raped her. \n  \n\n      She walked the jury through a floor plan of the sixth floor from the relevant time period, describing the layout and fitting rooms on that floor as a wooden-walled room with walls that met the ceiling. The fitting room door locked automatically when closed, she testified.\n  \n\n      Beall said the store had a practice of keeping fitting room doors closed while not in use, but they’d “regularly” be left open.\n  \n\n      Bergdorf Goodman scheduled at least one person to monitor each department at all times but it was not uncommon that the area on the sixth floor would be left unmanned, especially on a slow evening, Beall said.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      The cold open of “Saturday Night Live” featured comedian James Austin Johnson considering possible jail time as an indicted former President Donald Trump.\n  \n\n      “Well folks it happened. I got indicted,” Johnson said, later poking at rhetoric from the former president, saying, “What the radical left Democrats are doing to me is worse than any crime I’ve ever committed, and I’ve committed a lot.”\n  \n\n      Johnson as Trump joked he’d be putting out an album of 30 classic covers to raise money from supporters called, “Now That’s What I Call My Legal Defense Fund,” a play on the “Now That’s What I Call” compilation albums.  \n  \n\n      “Folks, your hard-earned money is important. If I go to jail, I would need money for commissary snacks,” Johnson said. “I will need a supply of ramens to successfully barter with a large man named Lizard.”\n  \n\n      He joked that the song “Justice For All,” an actual single released in March by a choir of men who are in prison for their participation in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 that features a recording of the former president, was a top download and beat “Flowers” by Miley Cyrus, “which, as we all know, is about Liam (Hemsworth).” \n  \n\n      The skit featured a series of cameos by other cast members portraying artists and known Trump supporters with duets on the fictional album, including Kenan Thompson as boxer Don King, Mikey Day as Donald Trump Jr. and Devon Walker as Afroman.  \n  \n\n      “I really don’t want to go to jail, but when I think about how shredded I might get, it’s awfully tempting,” Johnson quipped. \n  \n\n      The indictment marks the first time in US history that a current or former president has been criminally charged. The indictment was filed under seal and charges are not yet public.\n  \n\n      Trump is expected to appear in court Tuesday afternoon for his arraignment, sources tell CNN, and Johnson reminded viewers of the pending event when he closed out the skit by saying, “Manhattan, I’ll see you on Tuesday. We’ll be wild.”\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

                "content": "\n      Federal prosecutors investigating former President Donald Trump’s handling of classified documents are pressing multiple witnesses for details about their attorneys, including whether any of them have attempted to influence testimony in order to protect the former president, multiple sources tell CNN.\n  \n\n      Investigators have focused these questions toward a group of witnesses who either work for Trump or are represented by lawyers provided by him. In some instances, prosecutors have asked how witnesses found their lawyers and if they know how they were compensated during grand jury sessions.\n  \n\n      The line of questioning about Trump-provided attorneys suggests prosecutors are looking at any efforts by the former president to keep control over more than two dozen Mar-a-Lago staffers and political aides who have become central witnesses in recent months, and whose legal bills are paid by Trump. Investigators working for special counsel Jack Smith are exploring multiple facets of a possible obstruction case, and that could include whether testimony has been improperly influenced and coordinated within Trump’s legal network. \n  \n\n      No one has been charged with any crime in the federal documents probe. Yet prosecutors in recent weeks have moved aggressively to lock down witness testimony in the grand jury and have gathered significant documentary evidence that has moved them toward potentially making a case, according to one of the sources.\n  \n\n      “They wanted to know who’s paying, how did they invoice?” said one person familiar with the matter, referring to questions prosecutors have asked. Prosecutors asked witnesses questions like “‘Did they tell you what to say? Did they get you to alter your testimony?’” The source said. “Even if it were true, would anybody admit it?”\n  \n\nExclusive: How a box with classified documents ended up in Trump's office months after FBI searched Mar-a-Lago\n\n\n      Many of the defense lawyers representing these Trump-aligned witnesses have been paid by Trump’s Save America PAC.\n  \n\n      By the end of 2022, Save America had paid $16 million for lawyers who defend Trump himself and people who work for him in the ongoing probes and in response to other legal issues, such as Trump’s recent indictment in Manhattan and an upcoming trial opposite columnist E. Jean Carroll.  \n  \n\n      The PAC, which was set up days after the 2020 election and solicited millions in donations with baseless claims of election fraud, also keeps a handful of Trump staffers on its payroll, too. Several of Trump’s closest aides who are also now witnesses remain on his payroll and also receive hefty consulting fees through Save America PAC.\n  \n\n      It’s not unusual for deep-pocketed organizations to bankroll lawyers for their employees who need legal help to respond to criminal probes or lawsuits. Attorneys for several of the Trump witnesses have maintained that no matter where their funding comes from, the advice they provide to their clients is to protect them individually.\n  \n\n      Yet the Save America spending has caught the interest of special counsel investigators. Prosecutors have asked similar questions about Trump-provided lawyers as part of the parallel probe into January 6 and the effort to overturn the 2020 election, and even subpoenaed consultants who received Save America disbursements to trace the spending. \n  \n\n      In testimony to the House January 6 committee last year, former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson said that a Trump-backed attorney had tried to coach her into not sharing information to protect Trump. She eventually switched lawyers before providing extensive testimony to the committee and to the criminal investigators looking into January 6 and Trump.\n  \n\n      In comments last week following his indictment in Manhattan, Trump made references to those in his inner circle facing questions from federal investigators, saying “the people who work for me” were being harassed.\n  \n\n      “We have this Jack Smith lunatic threatening people every day through his representatives. They’re threatening jail terms, but talk about Trump and you’ll go free,” Trump said in his speech hours after pleading not guilty to the business-related charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n  \n\n      Peter Carr, a spokesman for Smith’s office at the Justice Department, declined to comment.\n  \n\n      CNN previously reported one aide close to Trump, Walt Nauta, had told the FBI about Trump directing that boxes be moved out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago after the Justice Department subpoenaed all classified records in his possession. Nauta, who serves as a body-man to the former President and even traveled to New York with him for his arrest last week, initially denied handling the boxes but was captured on surveillance footage. Nauta’s attorney Stanley Woodward declined to comment.\n  \n\n      In recent months, a Mar-a-Lago employee who helped Nauta move the boxes has spoken to investigators, sources familiar with the probe say.\n  \n\n      Smith’s team also took aggressive steps to capture the grand jury testimony and notes of Evan Corcoran, one of Trump’s primary defense attorneys who responded to the subpoena, and have interviewed other attorneys on the team as well.\n  \n\n      In the past, Trump’s use of lawyers to do his bidding and keep people close to him in the fold has attracted extensive, repeated inquiries from prosecutors. \n  \n\n      In the Mueller investigation, prosecutors found that lawyers for Trump put public and private pressure on a handful of top advisers, including Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Rick Gates, as they considered plea deals to cooperate in the investigation. \n  \n\n  CNN’s Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Needless to say, it has been a wild 48 hours in media, with multiple consequential stories breaking one after another. And a lot of questions still remain. Here's the latest information we have at the moment on each of the giant stories reverberating in the industry.\nThe Cancellation of Carlson\nCNN Photo Illustration/Seth Wenig/AP\nWhy? \n \n\nThat is the question I have been asked — and expect to continue to be asked — more than any other after the seismic news that Fox News had fired its highest-rated host, Tucker Carlson. The news, which rocked both the media and political worlds, begs for an answer to that fundamental question. \n\n \n\nBut answering it is anything but easy. In the hours following Carlson's abrupt dismissal from the right-wing channel, a number of explanations have emerged — all with plausibility. It goes without saying that it was no coincidence that the dismissal came just days after Fox's historic settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. But what specifically about that case prompted Carlson's undoing remains murky.\n\n \n\nPerhaps it was related to ex-producer Abby Grossberg's lawsuit against the network, which alleged rampant sexism and anti-Semitic behavior behind the scenes at Carlson's show? Or perhaps it was profanity-laced remarks, some of which were redacted in the Dominion discovery documents, that Carlson privately made, disparaging his colleagues, including Fox brass? Or perhaps Rupert Murdoch, and his chief executive son Lachlan, wanted to send a message about who is ultimately in command at the company after having been embarrassed for months with the public airing of Fox's dirty laundry?\n\n \n\nIt's possible it was all of the above, given that each of the issues are intertwined. For its part, Fox News did not offer an explanation for Carlson's ouster in the short statement the network put out announcing the bombshell decision. \"We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,\" Fox News said. Carlson also offered no comment on Monday, ignoring my many texts and phone calls seeking information. \n \n\nWhich leaves us in a frustrating position. We know the basic contours of how the decision was made (Lachlan Murdoch and Suzanne Scott came to agreement Friday evening about canceling Carlson's show and informed him on Monday morning, just before publicly announcing the news). But we are unable to say definitively, for now, what led to the firing of one of the most powerful figures in modern American media and politics.\n \nOne veteran television news executive told me that they believed the decision came down to a straightforward calculation by the Murdochs: Risk versus reward. \"There's a lot of drama and intrigue, but this is always about managing risk vs reward,\" the person said.\n \n\"I know that’s not very exciting, but it’s how these decisions get made at the highest level,\" the executive added. \"A weighing of the negatives - and risks to the business - versus the positives or benefits.\"\n \n\nAnd if you're the Murdochs, it is easy to say how holding on to Carlson comes with more much more risk than reward. Carlson is not a team player, and in fact is uncontrollable. He carries legal baggage, and the Murdochs are trying to put an end to the legal disputes they find themselves in. He regularly births negative news cycles about the network that tarnish the brand, and Fox News is desperate to emerge from the cloud of negative press it has been the subject of. Meanwhile, mainstream advertisers have stayed far away from Carlson's show, which is far too toxic to associate with.\n\n \n\nThe Murdochs also have plenty of evidence to support the bet that Fox News is bigger than any single person. Just look at Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Megyn Kelly, and others who have exited the network. None of them have bigger platforms today than they did when they were on Fox News. They all have a less powerful megaphone than the one they carried when employed by the Murdochs.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the network itself has endured. It is pretty much enshrined as a law of physics in the universe of right-wing media that whoever the Murdochs put in prime time will rate. In some cases, certain shows have out-rated their predecessors. Beck was replaced by the higher rated \"The Five,\" for instance.\n \n\nAll that said, Carlson will test the hypothesis that Fox News as a brand trumps any single personality. Carlson is a force unlike any other in right-wing media and politics. He commands a loyal audience that is really not akin to anything else in the space. If he were to turn up on another channel, it's certainly possible that a not-so-insignificant chunk of his audience would follow him over — especially with former President Donald Trump eager to rip the Murdochs and fan chaos in right-wing media. \n\n \nWhich is all to say that, while the Murdochs may have made a calculated bet that the odds will remain in their favor, it is still a bet. And it's not clear exactly how things will shake out when the dice land.\n\n———  BELOW THE FOLD  ———\nCNN Photo Illustration/Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLemon Squeezed Out: Don Lemon's 17 years at CNN came to an astonishing conclusion on Monday. \"CNN and Don have parted ways,\" CNN chief Chris Licht said in an afternoon note to staffers, sending shockwaves both inside and outside the network. \"Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.\" Licht's note offered no explanation for Lemon's abrupt exit, but sources indicated internal research that CNN had conducted signaled the longtime anchor had alienated part of the network’s audience after his sexist comments about Nikki Haley earlier this year, which he apologized for. Some guests in recent weeks had expressed reservations about appearing on-air with Lemon, the sources added. \"It was an accumulation of a lot of stuff,\" one of the people said about the move to sever ties. I’m told that Lemon’s co-hosts, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, were informed about the decision before it was announced publicly. \n \nIn a blistering statement of his own, Lemon punched back. After having appeared on-air for \"CNN This Morning\" as usual, Lemon said that his agent notified him later in the morning that he had been \"terminated\" by the network. \"I am stunned,\" Lemon said in his statement. \"After 17 years at CNN, I would have thought that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly.\" Lemon went on to thank colleagues for \"an incredible run,\" saying he wished his former coworkers \"all the best.\" In a follow-up statement, CNN disputed Lemon's version of events, saying he \"was offered an opportunity to meet with management.\" A person close to Lemon said no specific reason had been given to the star anchor for the decision to cut him from the anchor roster. Sources in both camps indicated that Lemon, who just signed a new deal when he was named co-host of \"CNN This Morning,\" is expected to have his contract paid out.\n \n🔎 Zooming in: Lemon’s departure presents Licht another programming conundrum. Licht, whose primetime programming bloc still remains under construction, will now need to reconfigure \"CNN This Morning,\" which just launched six months ago. Collins has been one of the anchors who has recently hosted CNN’s 9pm hour, raising speculation that she could be tapped for the prime time slot. If that were the case, it would leave Licht an opportunity to nearly entirely reset the morning show.\n\nCNN Photo Illustration/Eric Gaillard/Reuters\n\nShell Shocker: Details emerged on Monday pertaining to Jeff Shell's (also stunning) exit as the top boss at NBCU. Comcast said in an SEC filing that it had fired Shell after an allegations from a female employee of sexual harassment. That complaint was lodged by CNBC senior correspondent Hadley Gamble and it was made in the last several weeks, I'm told. An attorney for Gamble confirmed on Monday that the CNBC correspondent had made the complaint that led to Shell's termination. \"The investigation into Mr. Shell arose from a complaint by my client of sexual harassment and sex discrimination,\" attorney Suzanne McKie said. \"Given these circumstances it is very disappointing that my client’s name has been released and her privacy violated.\" CNN's Elizabeth Stuart and I have more here.\n\n \n🔎 Zooming in: The complaint filed by Gamble, sources told CNN, came after a contract dispute she had with the company. It's not clear whether Gamble, who appeared on CNBC as recently as last week, is still employed by NBCU. Her attorney and a rep for Comcast declined to say on Monday when asked.\n \n🔮 Into the future: In the interim, Comcast President Michale Cavanaugh will oversee Shell's portfolio. And I'm told that it should not be expected in the near future that a search for a Shell successor will be underway. In fact, Cavanaugh could oversee NBCU for some time. \n\nCracks in the House of Mouse: The Magic Kingdom doesn't feel so magical these days. Disney said Monday that it has resumed the painful process of laying off several thousand workers. It is the second and largest wave yet of cuts at the media giant as part of its previously announced plan to slash its workforce by 7,000 employees. The latest round of cuts is impacting ESPN, Disney’s entertainment division, Disney Parks, and its Experiences and Product division. It's part of a broader workforce reduction plan announced in February by chief executive Bob Iger in an aim to save $5.5 billion in costs. The new round of layoffs will bring the total number of jobs slashed across the company to 4,000, it said, with a third and final round of layoffs expected before summer. CNN's Jon Passantino has more here.\n\n \n\n🔎 Zooming in: No one is safe in the layoffs — including senior execs. Russell Wolff, who oversaw ESPN+, was impacted, The WSJ reported. And longtime ESPN spokesperson Mike Solty's was also cut.\n\nCNN Photo Illustration/Matt Rourke/AP\n\nBlue Checked Out: Elon Musk's attempts to salvage the disaster he created after stripping public figures of their legacy verification checkmarks has failed spectacularly. The erratic billionaire appended checkmarks to some celebrities over the weekend, in an apparent move to clean up his mess after realizing most people simply wouldn't fork over $8 a month for a blue badge. But several of these public figures have rejected the reapplication of the checks to their accounts, given that Musk has transformed the once-coveted symbol into one that is toxic. CNN's Brian Fung has details here. \n\n \n\n🔎 Is it legal? While a variety of voices on Twitter are suggesting Musk's mandatory verification claims run afoul of the law, the situation appears more complicated. The Verge's Adi Robertson writes: \"So let’s not lose sight of the real news: over the course of a single weekend, Twitter managed to turn its most coveted status symbol into something that (at least some) users are so upset to be associated with that they’re wondering if it’s illegal.\"\n\n\nThank you for reading!

Jean Carroll’s lawsuit alleging that Trump raped her in a New York dressing room in the mid-1990s and then defamed her years later when he denied it took place, said she wasn’t his “type,” and suggested she made up the story to promote a new book.\n  \n\n      Judge Lewis Kaplan said it was “pure speculation” that the attention around the indictment, which was “significantly (though certainly not entirely) invited or provoked by Mr. Trump’s own actions,” would affect the ability to select a jury.\n  \n\nTrump sues Michael Cohen for $500 million, alleging ex-attorney breached his contract\n\n\n      Trump’s attorneys had suggested there should be a one month delay because both the indictment and the trial allegations involve “sexual misconduct.”\n  \n\n      The judge said to suggest the “heart of the litigation” is the same “is just wrong.” He also noted this appeared to be another delay tactic by the Trump legal team.\n  \n\n      “It does not sit well for Mr. Trump to promote pretrial publicity and then to claim that coverage that he promoted was prejudicial to him and should be taken into account as supporting a further delay,” the judge added.\n  \n\n      Any bias, Kaplan wrote, would be rooted out during jury selection, which would likely include questions as to whether they are aware of Trump’s legal troubles.\n  \n\n      The judge previously ruled the jury would be anonymous in this case and has denied requests to make their identities known to either Carroll or Trump’s legal team, citing potential security risks stemming from Trump’s own rhetoric.\n  \n\n      Kaplan rejected another request to delay the trial after Trump’s legal team said they had recently learned that a billionaire donor to Democratic causes has funded some of Carroll’s litigation. The judge said he will allow Trump’s lawyers to ask Carroll limited questions about the payments in a narrowly tailored pre-trial deposition. He did not rule whether those questions would be permitted at trial.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

The case is set for trial in October. The Trumps have denied wrongdoing.\n  \n\n      The deposition has been scheduled this week as part of the discovery process. It’s unclear whether Trump is more willing to cooperate now.\n  \n\n      The former president’s attorneys have not responded to requests for comment.\n  \n\n      After his first sit-down in August, Trump and his legal team have been able to glean more knowledge about the allegations against him because documents and other materials have been turned over to them.\n  \n\n      Other strategic decisions could be at play. In a civil case, if a defendant asserts the Fifth Amendment, the jury can make what’s known as an “adverse inference” and place weight against Trump for refusing to answer questions.\n  \n\n      Last August, some of Trump’s attorneys advised him to assert the Fifth Amendment because of the potential risk he could put himself in due to the Manhattan district attorney’s office ongoing investigation into the same issues in the attorney general’s civil case.\n  \n\n      Trump has switched up his legal team since then.\n  \n\n      Ronald Fischetti – who represented Trump in the matter last fall – attended that deposition and advised Trump to not answer questions, told CNN on Monday: “I know nothing about this.”\n  \n\n      Last year, sitting before James and her team, Trump criticized her and her office.\n  \n\n      “Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,” Trump said in a video of the deposition released by the Attorney General’s Office. “One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly by accident, by mistake, such as it was a sunny, beautiful day when actually it was slightly overcast, would be met by law enforcement.”\n  \n\n      Trump’s trip to New York comes on the heels of his unprecedented indictment obtained by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office last month. Last week, the former president was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to 34 charges of falsifying business records following an investigation into hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.   \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      E. Jean Carroll and two other women will testify in the battery and defamation trial against former President Donald Trump to show Trump’s pattern of alleged violent behavior, Carroll’s attorney told jurors during opening statements on Tuesday. \n  \n\n      “Three women, one clear pattern,” attorney Shawn Crowley said. “Start with a friendly encounter in a semi-public place. All of a sudden pounce, kiss, grab, grope. Don’t wait. When you are a star, you can do anything you want. And when they speak up about what happened, attack. Humiliate them. Call them liars. Call them too ugly to assault.”\n  \n\nE. Jean Carroll battery and defamation trial against Donald Trump begins: What to know\n\n\n      Carroll is suing Trump for battery and defamation, alleging that he raped her in a Manhattan luxury department store dressing room in the spring of 1996 and then defamed her years later when she went public with the allegations. A jury was seated Tuesday and the first witnesses will appear beginning Wednesday.\n  \n\n      Carroll is expected to testify Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. The first witness is expected to be Cheryl Beal, who worked at Bergdorf Goodman, the source said. \n  \n\n      “You, of course, are going to hear from Ms. Carroll herself,” Crowley said. “She will testify about her traumatic encounter with Donald Trump, about her decision to stay silent so long, and about how when she finally did speak publicly, Donald Trump responded with vicious lies meant to destroy her.”\n  \n\n      Carroll will candidly acknowledge the shame she felt about the alleged assault and her decision not to come forward sooner. “How could she tell the world that she had been dumb enough to go into a dressing room with Donald Trump,” Carroll thought to herself, according to her attorney. \n  \n\n      At the time Carroll didn’t view Trump as dangerous, but a “character” and “a man about town,” Crowley said.\n  \n\n      Jurors won’t have to base their decision solely on Carroll’s testimony, the attorney said, because two friends to Carroll will corroborate her account and two former Bergdorf Goodman employees who worked at the store in 1996 will corroborate details of Carroll’s account. They’ll testify that they personally saw Trump shop at Bergdorf Goodman several times during that time period, a fact Trump has previously contested. \n  \n\n      Trump’s attorney Joe Tacopina said during his opening statement Carroll conspired against the former president with the two women, Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff, because they hate him politically. \n  \n\n      “They schemed to hurt Donald Trump politically,” Trump’s attorney said trial evidence will show.\n  \n\n      Tacopina told the jury they’re not there to consider the accounts of those two women. \n  \n\n      “That’s not for you to decide here,” Tacopina said. “Those people have never made a claim. No one has ever told the police, including Ms. Carroll. No one. Because that would require a real investigation. No one has ever done that. But they want you to focus on anything but the E. Jean Carroll story because it is so incredible and so unbelievable.”\n  \n\n      Tacopina asked the jury to focus on the matter at hand and called Carroll’s account vague and inconsistent. \n  \n\n      “It all comes down to do you believe the unbelievable. Nothing else in this courtroom matters,” he said. \n  \n\n      The jury will see the “Access Hollywood” tape that captured Trump graphically describing how he would use his stardom to aggressively come on to women, Carroll’s attorney said.\n  \n\n      “You’ll hear him bragging about doing almost the same thing he did to Ms. Carroll to other women,” Carroll’s attorney said.\n  \n\n      Trump has previously said his language on the tape was “locker room talk” not based in truth. \n  \n\n      “This is not locker room talk, it’s exactly what he did to Ms. Carroll and other women,” Crowley said in court Tuesday.\n  \n\n      Trump’s attorney acknowledged the Access Hollywood tape was foolish but not an admission. \n  \n\n      “It’s foolish, but it is locker room talk,” Tacopina said.  \n  \n\n      On Tuesday, Tacopina walked through Carroll’s alleged account line by line, questioning the plausibility of some details and mocking it at times. \n  \n\n      Carroll “did not produce any objective evidence to back up her claim because it didn’t happen,” the attorney said. Carroll, a columnist known to keep a diary, did not document the account in her personal diary, Tacopina added. \n  \n\n      “She is abusing the system by advancing a false claim of rape for money, for political reasons and for status and in doing so she’s really minimizing the true rape victims,” Tacopina said. “She’s exploiting their pain and their suffering.”\n  \n\n      He told the jurors that they can feel free to hate Trump. \n  \n\n      “People have very strong feelings about Donald Trump,” Tacopina said. “You can hate Donald Trump, it’s okay. There’s a time and a secret place for that. It’s called a ballot box. But not here in the court of law.”\n  \n\n      Trump’s legal team will not put on a lengthy case in his defense, Tacopina suggested, but will seek to knock down Carroll’s case during cross examination of plaintiff witnesses. \n  \n\n      “It’s coming out through the questioning of their witnesses. That’s our entire defense. That and some sworn testimony from Donald Trump that you’re going to see,” Tacopina said. “There are no witnesses to call to prove a negative.”\n  \n\n      Trump is unlikely to testify in his own defense, but will rely on previous denials including in a video deposition taken last October in this case, Tacopina also suggested. \n  \n\n      “There’s absolutely nothing more for him to add,” the lawyer said.  “I don’t want to distract from the focus of her story.”\n  \n\n      After the jury was dismissed for the day Judge Lewis Kaplan challenged Tacopina to confirm that Trump would not testify in his own defense. \n  \n\n      Tacopina said he still doesn’t know definitively whether Trump will testify. \n  \n\n      The judge told Trump’s counsel that it’s an imposition on court staff and security to leave the question unanswered and so Tacopina must inform the court definitively at some point this week. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

He appeared in court on behalf of the former president for sealed proceedings related to that part of Smith’s probe just days after his testimony in the Mar-a-Lago documents case.\n  \n\n      Corcoran could still resume representing Trump in the documents case now that he has testified.\n  \n\n      It’s not known how valuable the evidence and testimony he provided to the grand jury will be for prosecutors. He testified twice to the grand jury and turned over documents. \n  \n\n      Corcoran’s own defense attorney declined to comment. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Saturday, “These unnamed sources have no idea what’s actually going on and are peddling disinformation.”\n  \n\n      Corcoran had a window into many of the moments in which Trump and his team were responding to the federal government’s efforts to get classified documents back.\n  \n\n      He first appeared before the grand jury in January but refused to answer questions that would have divulged his advice to Trump and their conversations, citing attorney-client privilege, a source previously told CNN. Prosecutors were then prompted to take the unusual step of fighting in court to force him to respond, and a federal court ruled prior to his reappearance in front of the grand jury in March that he could not withhold information any longer about communications he’d had with Trump leading up to the search.\n  \n\n      Prosecutors sought to ask Corcoran about his direct interactions with Trump regarding a May 2022 subpoena for all classified records in the former president’s possession, the subsequent search for classified records, and about conversations they’d had when the Trump Organization received a separate subpoena for surveillance video of the club.\n  \n\n      Corcoran drafted a statement in June that claimed Trump’s team had done a diligent search for boxes and were handing over classified records they found in response to the May subpoena. Then, months later, the FBI found hundreds more pages with classified markings in its search of Mar-a-Lago, a pivotal development in the records mishandling and obstruction of justice probe.\n  \n\n      In recent weeks, the grand jury activity, including Corcoran’s forced testimony, has made clear that prosecutors are nailing down evidence from scores of sources that could be used in a case against Trump.\n  \n\n      The former president has not been charged with any federal crime.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n\n  CNN’s Kaanita Iyer, Evan Perez, and Sara Murray contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Jean Carroll’s assault and defamation claims against him – but his attendance should not be necessary because it would be a “burden” on the city and court.\n  \n\n      The letter to the judge, from attorney Joseph Tacopina, appears to argue that Trump shouldn’t attend his civil trial without saying he won’t.\n  \n\n      “Defendant Trump wishes to appear at trial,” the letter states, but adds “concern” that New York City and the court would face “logistical and financial burdens” to have a former president travel with the Secret Service and other security protections to the proceedings.\n  \n\n      “In order for Defendant Trump to appear, his movement would need to be coordinated preliminarily by a Secret Service advance team hours beforehand each day that he is present, so that a tactical plan may be developed,” such as locking down parts of the courthouse, Tacopina said. Tacopina raised the disruption Trump’s recent criminal arraignment caused in the state court as an example.\n  \n\nManhattan DA and House Republicans square off in court over intimidation lawsuit\n\n\n      “Your consideration is greatly appreciated,” Tacopina added. \n  \n\n      Jury selection begins next Tuesday in Carroll’s lawsuit alleging that Trump raped her in a New York dressing room in the mid-1990s and then defamed her years later when he denied it took place, said she wasn’t his “type,” and suggested she made up the story to promote a new book.

If he does not appear, his legal team asks the judge to instruct jurors that he isn’t required to attend and he wouldn’t be there because of the logistical burdens. \n  \n\n      Carroll plans to attend the trial, her attorney has said.\n  \n\n      In a response to the court on Wednesday afternoon, Carroll’s attorney criticized Trump’s reasoning, but indicated that a live appearance from the former president was not needed for the trial.\n  \n\n      “Either way, Ms. Carroll has a right to play Donald Trump’s deposition at trial,” the lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, wrote, “so she has no need for him to testify live.”\n  \n\n      “Mr. Trump has yet to answer the Court’s question, and he now asks the Court to deliver an excuse to the jury in the event he decides not to attend trial,” Kaplan wrote. “Given the gravity of the allegations at issue in this case, one might expect Mr. Trump to appear in person. But he is obviously free to choose otherwise … This Court and the City it calls home are fully equipped to handle any logistical burdens that may result from Mr. Trump’s appearance at a weeklong trial.”\n  \n\n      They also noted Trump has traveled for other recent events, including an Ultimate Fighting Championship event, and has a campaign appearance scheduled two days into the trial.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in Manhattan criminal court Tuesday afternoon.\n  \n\n      Trump surrendered and was placed under arrest Tuesday before he was arraigned in a historic and unprecedented court appearance, in which the former president heard the charges against him for the first time. While the arraignment was routine, the case is now poised to linger over Trump’s 2024 candidacy as he fights the charges both in court and in public.\n  \n\n      Prosecutors alleged that Trump sought to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election through a hush money scheme with payments made to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump. He has denied the affairs. \n  \n\n      Trump was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, including an illegal payment of $130,000 that was ordered by the defendant to suppress the negative information that would hurt his campaign, prosecutors alleged. \n  \n\n      Trump “repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election,” according to the charging documents.\n  \n\n      After the arraignment, Trump immediately flew back to Florida. He held an event with his supporters Tuesday evening at his Mar-a-Lago resort, where Trump made his public case against the indictment and previewed how he intends to fight against the charges politically as he runs again for the White House in 2024. \n  \n\n      While he was warned by Judge Juan Merchan during Tuesday’s arraignment not to make comments that could “jeopardize the rule of law” or create civil unrest, Trump railed later that evening against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the judge himself.\n  \n\n      “I never thought anything like this could happen in America, never thought it could happen. The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it,” Trump said.\n  \n\n      “It’s an insult to our country,” he added.\n  \n\n      The indictment returned last week by a grand jury against Trump was unsealed Tuesday and provided the public – and Trump’s legal team – with the first details about the specific charges he will face.\n  \n\n      The indictment was quickly criticized by Trump’s Republican allies, and even some legal experts raised questions about the case. CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig said that prosecutors will have to make their case that Trump committed felonies and not misdemeanors by showing that the falsified records were used to conceal another crime, which was not identified in the indictment.\n  \n\n      “One of the complicated legal questions here is in order to bump that up from a misdemeanor to a felony you have to show that those records were falsified to commit some other crime, some second crime,” Honig said. “You heard the defense lawyers, I think, rightly, complaining about that.”\n  \n\n      Bragg said at a news conference after the arraignment that the indictment did not specify what laws Trump broke because “the law does not so require.”\n  \n\n      Bragg highlighted one law that Trump allegedly broke during the conference: “New York state election law – what makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means.” He also mentioned violations of a federal election law capping contribution limits. \n  \n\n      The evidence, Bragg said, will be “borne out in a public courtroom in downtown Manhattan,” he said.\n  \n\n      Trump responded to the judge when directed to do so during the arraignment and made the not guilty plea himself. \n  \n\n      The former president’s voice was measured in the courtroom. He walked in slowly scanning the reporters in the courtroom and looked at the judge when he was speaking. \n  \n\n      The next in-person hearing date for Trump’s case in New York is currently set for December 4.\n  \n\n      In addition to the indictment, a 13-page “statement of facts” detailed in plain language how Trump allegedly committed crimes to help him get elected to the White House in 2016.  \n  \n\nTrump to surrender and face historic criminal charges in New York court\n\n\n      “From August 2015 to December 2017, the Defendant orchestrated a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the Defendant’s electoral prospects,” the statement of facts says. Prosecutors described a “catch and kill scheme” to suppress negative stories about Trump – “in furtherance of his candidacy for President.” \n  \n\n      Each criminal charge Trump is facing relates to a specific entry among the business records of the Trump Organization, according to the indictment.   \n  \n\n      The Manhattan prosecutors accuse Trump of repeatedly causing false entries in the business records.  \n  \n\n      A judge said Monday night that news outlets were not allowed to broadcast the proceedings, rejecting a request from several media organizations, including CNN. Five still photographers, however, were allowed to take pictures of Trump and the courtroom before the hearing begins. \n  \n\n      While there had been some discussion about Trump speaking to the media while in the courthouse Tuesday, he did not do so. Instead, Trump responded at his event at Mar-a-Lago that night, making his first on-camera remarks while surrounded by supporters.\n  \n\n      Trump has consistently denied all wrongdoing and condemned the indictment as political persecution.\n  \n\n      Some of Trump’s comments came to the fore during the arraignment when prosecutors handed the judge a packet of Trump’s social media postings and informed the court that Trump was making threats  with “irresponsible” social media posts, specifically citing Trump’s sharing of an article that showed a photo of Trump with a baseball bat. \n  \n\n      Trump’s attorneys responded that Trump has First Amendment rights and said that he was expressing his frustration with alleged illegal leaks about the indictment from the district attorney’s office. Trump’s lawyers also claimed that Trump’s social media posts were not threatening. \n  \n\n      Merchan acknowledged Trump’s right to free speech, but warned both sides about making comments with the potential to “incite violence, create civil unrest or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.”  \n  \n\n      Neither side made a request for a gag order.\n  \n\n      Despite the judge’s comments, Trump in his speech Tuesday evening claimed he had a “Trump-hating judge” in the New York case. Trump also attacked Bragg and the indictment – as well as the other prosecutors investigating him, President Joe Biden and additional political opponents.\n  \n\n      “This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election. And it should be dropped immediately,” Trump said.\n  \n\n      Bragg’s indictment marks the first criminal charges against Trump, but it’s not the only potential legal trouble in front of the former president: Special counsel Jack Smith is still moving forward with an investigation into Trump’s role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. And a Fulton County special grand jury has completed its investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\n  \n\nInside Donald Trump's rocky relationship with the Supreme Court  \n\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify where prosecutors made allegations against Trump regarding the 2016 election. It was in court documents.\n\n\n  CNN’s Tierney Sneed and Celina Tebor contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

                "content": "\n      The defamation clash between Fox News and a small election services firm, due to go to trial this week, represents the most significant moment yet in which those who disseminated former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen must answer for conduct that is still poisoning American democracy.\n  \n\n      Dominion Voting Systems alleges the conservative network promulgated the ex-president’s conspiracy theories, including about its voting machines, to avoid alienating its viewers and for the good of its bottom line.\n  \n\n      The trial had been scheduled to open Monday but the judge announced Sunday evening it’d be delayed until Tuesday. The reason was not immediately clear. But The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch, reported that Fox had made a late push to settle the dispute out of court, citing people familiar with the matter.\n  \n\nFox News-Dominion trial abruptly delayed on eve of opening statements \n\n\n      The drama expected to play out in a Delaware courtroom represents an extraordinary moment in modern American history because it could show how truth has been tarnished as a political currency and highlight a right-wing business model that depends on spinning an alternative reality. And yet, it remains unclear whether Trump – the primary author of the corrosive conspiracies that the 2020 election was fraudulent – will end up paying a significant personal or political price.\n  \n\n      The idea that Trump’s claims – echoed by his aides and allies on Fox and sometimes by the channel’s personalities – had any merit will not even make it to first base in the trial. In one remarkable development during pre-trial hearings, presiding Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled that jurors did not even need to decide one key issue: whether Fox’s claims about Dominion were true.\n  \n\n      “The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,” Davis wrote, in a ruling last month that significantly narrowed the network’s avenues to mount a defense.\n  \n\n      The epic case now turns on an attempt by Dominion to prove the legal standard for defamation that Fox must have known (or strongly suspected) it was lying about the issues at hand at the time and that it acted with “actual malice.”\n  \n\n      Though he vigorously denies breaking any laws, the former president appears to face the possibility of indictment in probes into his attempt to overturn President Joe Biden’s election victory by a district attorney in Georgia and by special counsel Jack Smith into his conduct in the lead-up to the US Capitol insurrection. And the many layers of Trump’s democracy-damaging behavior were catalogued in interviews and public testimony taken by a House select committee when Democrats controlled the chamber last year.\n  \n\n      But the falsehood of a corrupt election still forms the bedrock of Trump’s 2024 campaign to win back the White House. Millions of Trump’s supporters have bought into the idea that he was illegally ejected from office on the premise that he really won in 2020. \n  \n\n      It’s also questionable whether viewers of conservative media will hear much about the trial and get sufficient information that might convince them to change their minds about 2020.\n  \n\n      Trump’s insistence that the election was stained by fraud is giving some senior Republicans nightmares as they try to rebound from his loss in 2020 and work through their disappointment at the lack of a “red wave” in the last year’s midterms, despite winning the House. \n  \n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp says GOP can't be 'distracted' by Trump investigations if it wants to win in 2024\n\n\n      As Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp put it on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, the ex-president is forcing his party to keep looking in the rearview mirror and hampering its effort to look to the future.\n  \n\n      One core argument in court will likely be trying to show that Fox believed that telling the audience inconvenient truths was bad for business – a factor that drove right-wing media in 2020 and still holds true today. Proof of this can be seen in the way the Republican Party remains unwilling to anger its base voters two years on. While many top party leaders have signaled they want to move on from Trump, the only part of the GOP that has power in Washington – the House Republican majority – has made repeated efforts to shield Trump from accountability over the 2020 election and to distort what actually happened on January 6, 2021.\n  \n\n      But the court proceeding against Fox – like the constitutional process that assured a transfer of power between Trump and Biden, albeit one marred by violence – shows that the country’s instruments of accountability remain intact, despite Trump’s efforts.\n  \n\n      Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, deny wrongdoing. They’ve argued that their conspiracy theory-filled broadcasts after the 2020 election were protected by the First Amendment and that a loss in the case would be a devastating blow to press freedoms.\n  \n\n      But the run-up to the trial has been a catalog of embarrassments and reversals for both the network and the broader premise that there is anything to Trump’s false claims.\n  \n\nWhat to know about the Fox News and Dominion trial\n\n\n      The judge, for instance, observed last week in pre-trial hearings that there were well established and accepted limits on First Amendment rights.\n  \n\n      “To go up there and say, ‘What Fox did was protected by the First Amendment,’ it’s half the story. It’s protected by the First Amendment if you can’t demonstrate actual malice,” he said.\n  \n\n      Texts and emails between Fox personalities and managers, and depositions released by Dominion, suggest that privately, some at the channel dismissed Trump’s claims but amplified them amid growing fears that telling the truth might force viewers to turn elsewhere. \n  \n\n      For example, Murdoch emailed Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott telling her that rival conservative network Newsmax needed to be “watched.” In another message, Fox anchor Tucker Carlson told his colleague Laura Ingraham, “Our viewers are good people and they believe [the election fraud claims].”\n  \n\n      Fox has accused Dominion of cherry picking damaging quotes and texts ahead of the trial. But the evidence that has emerged suggests that Fox’s desire to cater to the beliefs of its viewers, even with untrue information, is closely allied to Trump’s own approach and reflects the way in which the Republican Party has been loath to antagonize the ex-president’s supporters.\n  \n\n      From the opening hours of his presidency, Trump made clear he would create an alternative vision of reality that his supporters could embrace and that would help him subvert the rules and conventions of the presidency. The angry exhortations by Trump’s first press secretary, Sean Spicer, in January 2017 that his boss had attracted the biggest inauguration crowd in history seemed at the time bizarre and absurd. But in retrospect, they were the first sign of a daily effort to destroy truth for Trump’s political benefit, which eventually morphed into lies about a stolen election that convinced many of the ex-president’s supporters. The culmination of all this was the mob attack by his supporters on Congress on January 6, 2021, during the certification of Biden’s victory.\n  \n\n      The idea that the Fox defamation trial might actually play a role in purging lies about the 2020 election seems far-fetched because the power of his falsehoods has survived many previous collisions with the truth. Although multiple courts in multiple states threw out Trump’s cases alleging election fraud after the 2020 election, the idea that the election was stolen still undermined faith in American democracy among his supporters. Only 29% of Republicans in a CNN/SSRS poll published in July 2022 had confidence that US elections truly represent the will of the people.\n  \n\n      This is, perhaps, not surprising. Because when he was in office, Trump made no secret of his strategy, telling the world in a moment of candor how he operated. \n  \n\n      “Stick with us. Don’t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news,” he said in a directive to his supporters at a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Kansas City in 2018. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.” \n  \n\n      Five years on, Trump is still at it.\n  \n\n      “We won in 2016. We won by much more in 2020 but it was rigged,” Trump said in the first big rally of his campaign in Waco, Texas, at the end of March.\n  \n\n      The fact that Trump continues to spread such falsehoods – and that many in the Republican Party remain unwilling to challenge him – irks some party leaders who watched as Trump’s handpicked candidates, who touted his election lies as the price of his endorsement, flamed out in swing states in last year’s midterm elections.\n  \n\n      Georgia’s Kemp warned, for example, that constantly bringing up 2020 would create another political disaster for his party.\n  \n\n      “I think any candidate, to be able to win, is to talk about what we’re for, focus on the future, not look in the rearview mirror,” Kemp told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday.\n  \n\n      “If you look in the rearview mirror too long while you’re driving, you’re going to look up, and you’re going to be running into somebody, and that’s not going to be good.”\n  \n\n      Yet the fact that Trump, according to many polls, remains the front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2024 and is still wildly popular with conservative grassroots voters suggests that it will take far more than a courtroom display to restore the truth about 2020.\n  \n\n      And the GOP will likely be looking in the rearview mirror for some time to come.\n  \n\n  Marshall Cohen contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      The question put to South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, hours after he announced plans to run for the Republican presidential nomination, was a simple one: How do you plan to defeat Donald Trump?\n  \n\n      Scott spoke for nearly a minute, discussing his mother, his belief in the power of prayer and his “faith in God and faith in our future.” When Fox and Friends co-host Steve Doocy lightly pressed for a more direct answer, Scott shook him off again.\n  \n\n      “As opposed to trying to have a conversation about how to beat a Republican,” he said, “I think we’re better off having a conversation about beating Joe Biden.” \n  \n\n      Scott, like his fellow GOP presidential contenders, is itching to take on the Democratic president, who is now poised to officially launch his reelection bid. But their first challenge will be getting through the Republican primary – and unseating Trump as the party’s standard bearer.\n  \n\n      Even with Trump facing a historic indictment and ongoing questions about his perpetuation of election lies, his challengers are still deeply reluctant to take on the former president, who sits atop almost every poll of the field despite numerous legal issues and the widespread rejection of his chosen candidates in the 2022 midterms. Trump picked up a key endorsement on Monday from the head of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm.\n  \n\n      Whether it’s a fear of alienating his core supporters or taking a social media drubbing, this new class of candidates – some officially in, others plotting their entry – has been careful in their remarks about Trump, largely steering clear of sharp criticism in favor of the occasional implicit jab, the kind that often fails to register with the average voter, or subtle indications of opposing policy views.\n  \n\n      “It’d be virtually impossible for somebody to break through in a constructive way at this stage,” said Alex Conant, a GOP strategist and veteran of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign. Conant said most 2024 primary voters have not yet tuned in and Trump is soaking up the relatively scant media attention on the race.\n  \n\n      Trump’s lesser-known rivals, he added, need to use the coming months to introduce themselves to voters and make favorable first impressions before they risk alienating Republican voters by taking on the still-popular former president. \n  \n\n      “To beat Trump, you have to either be a really good counter-puncher, or successfully ride the bubble. And neither of those things are easy,” Conant said. “Nobody has ever proven to be a good counter-puncher to Trump, and Biden’s the only one who’s ever really rode the bubble.”\n  \n\n      Unlike in 2015 and 2016, when he was a political unknown, Trump now has a lengthy track record in office for opponents to exploit: His four years as president; his failed efforts to challenge the outcome of the 2020 election; his supporters’ attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021; and mounting legal troubles, including his indictment in New York City over a hush money scheme and other looming challenges.\n  \n\n      Still, there has been almost no attempt to use his record against him, whether by invoking the Republican congressional majorities lost on his watch, his defeat in 2020, or the election denial movement that sparked a deadly riot at the Capitol and a crop of unelectable, extremist candidates in 2022.\n  \n\n      Leading Republicans have almost unanimously surmised that there is no avenue for parlaying those events against Trump in a primary campaign. \n  \n\n      “It’s shaping up to be 2016 all over again,” said Jason Roe, a Michigan Republican strategist and former executive director of the state GOP. Trump has “been able to suck up all the oxygen, and he’s doing it sooner in the cycle than he did eight years ago. It also looks a lot like ’16 with the number of candidates that are making noise about running.” \n  \n\n      In the early stages of the campaign, Trump’s rivals have mostly tried to execute bespoke campaign strategies under the former president’s exceptionally sensitive radar. \n  \n\n      Roe said it might be wise for expected 2024 candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to wait to enter the race, ideally limiting their exposure and hoping Trump “racks up a few more problems and starts to look like a liability.”\n  \n\n      Trump’s seemingly inevitable cratering, though, was what his 2016 rivals waited for – and it never came. \n  \n\n      Now a former president, Trump might be facing different challenges this time around, but his appeal remains unique. Few candidates see their fundraising totals spike after being indicted, as he did this month. And with no example of a rival who benefited from launching a full frontal attack on him, this year’s rivals are reluctant to leave their trenches. \n  \n\n      Another Republican strategist, who worked for a rival campaign in 2016 and has spoken with others this year, agreed that candidates were wise to delay their confrontations with Trump but warned against relying on outdated practices when the time came.\n  \n\n      “A candidate has to understand that that is what it’s like running against Donald Trump,” the strategist told CNN. “The age of having carefully controlled media appearances and a moderate approach to content creation – that is not going to work against Trump, who, whether he wants to make news or somebody else wants to make news about him, it happens every single day. It happens constantly. And the only way to occupy attention in a voter’s mind is to fight him for that space.”\n  \n\n      DeSantis, considered Trump’s top competition, has been at the front of the line among high profile Republicans in trying to win over conservatives angered by progressive-minded cultural and business trends. He routinely slams DEI – or “diversity, equity and inclusion” – programs at colleges and in corporations in his bid to appeal to GOP right-wingers who previously backed Trump.\n  \n\n      DeSantis also needled the former president shortly before Trump’s indictment by a New York City prosecutor over hush money payments to a porn actress, telling reporters in Florida, “I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair – I just, I can’t speak to that.”\n  \n\n      But DeSantis, like so many others either in or considering a primary run, effectively defended Trump by attacking the Democratic prosecutor and echoed Trump in casting the case as a witch hunt. \n  \n\n      “The weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. It is un-American,” DeSantis tweeted.\n  \n\n      Former Vice President Mike Pence, another potential primary candidate, has gone further than most in condemning Trump’s actions before and during the January 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol. At an event last month in Washington, Pence – whose life was threatened by violent Trump supporters after he refused not to certify the 2020 presidential election results – issued his most stark criticism of his former running mate to date.\n  \n\n      “What happened (on January 6) was a disgrace, and it mocks decency to portray it in any other way,” Pence said. “President Trump was wrong.”\n  \n\n      But Pence’s harsh words typically stop there. Just a few weeks after giving those remarks, he was among those defending Trump over his indictment. Describing the decision as “an outrage,” Pence argued that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was politically motivated.  \n  \n\n      After CNN’s Wolf Blitzer pointed out that a grand jury voted to charge Trump, Pence doubled down. \n  \n\n      “When you have an attorney general in New York, a Manhattan DA, that targeted one particular American in their campaigns, I think that offends the notion of the overwhelming majority of the American people who believe in fairness, who believe in equal treatment before the law,” Pence said.\n  \n\n      David Kochel, a veteran Iowa Republican strategist, urged caution in assessing the 2024 race – and expressed some optimism that the past was not destined to repeat itself.\n  \n\n      “I think it’ll be a much smaller field than 2016, and I also think that probably a few of the campaigns will get out earlier, because I think everybody is aware that the dynamic of 2016 is a losing dynamic when you’ve got somebody who’s famous with as fixed a base as Trump has,” he said. \n  \n\n      Potential candidates like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan recently ruled out runs, but the field is still expected to grow. Scott, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are already in. DeSantis and Pence are nearly sure bets to join them and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie looks increasingly likely to try his luck. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu is also weighing his options.\n  \n\n      DeSantis is widely considered the best bet among that group to outlast Trump in a one-on-one competition. But in a repeat of the traditions of 2016, that title has made him a target for attacks from others lower down the perceived pecking order. Christie, Sununu and Hutchinson have all rapped DeSantis over his feud with Disney, arguing that it undermines Republicans and the conservative message.\n  \n\n      “I think that’s not a conservative position. I think he’s wrong and I think rightfully makes a lot of people question his judgment and his maturity,” said Christie, who famously roasted Rubio on the debate stage in 2016 before bowing out and endorsing Trump, in a recent interview with Semafor.  \n  \n\n      Trump joined the pile-on against DeSantis, saying on his social media website Truth Social that the Florida governor was being “absolutely destroyed” by Disney. DeSantis has been clashing with Disney since last year, when the state passed a new law that limited classroom instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity and Disney objected to the bill. \n  \n\n      “His original P.R. plan fizzled, so now he’s going back with a new one in order to save face,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Disney’s next move will be the announcement that no more money will be invested in Florida because of the Governor - In fact, they could even announce a slow withdrawal or sale of certain properties, or the whole thing. Watch! That would be a killer. In the meantime, this is all so unnecessary, a political STUNT! Ron should work on the squatter MESS!”\n  \n\n      Establishment Republicans wary of Trump’s viability in a general election, if not his politics, have also revived another old, failed tactic in trying to keep the former president onside: the “loyalty pledge.” The subject protracted strife in 2016, and the party is now, as it did then, seeking to get promises from the primary candidates that they will support the eventual nominee, whoever it is.\n  \n\n      Trump signed the oath in September 2015, after some back-and-forth, but disavowed it the next spring, as the 2016 contest entered its final stages.\n  \n\n      At a CNN town hall that March, Anderson Cooper asked Trump whether he would stick by his pledge.\n  \n\n      “No, I don’t anymore,” Trump said. “No, we’ll see who it is.”\n  \n\n      Flash forward to 2023, and a similar dynamic appears to be unfolding. In February, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash she thought using a signed loyalty pledge as the price of admission to the debate stage was a “no-brainer.”\n  \n\n      In response, a Trump campaign spokesperson told CNN, “President Trump will support the Republican nominee because it will be him.” \n  \n\n      Weeks earlier, Trump demurred when asked if he’d consider backing anyone but himself for president, telling conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, “It would have to depend on who the nominee was.”\n  \n\n      Hutchinson, in an interview with Bash after McDaniel floated the pledge, questioned the idea, noting that it was clear for all to see that “the motivation (behind a pledge) is to keep Donald Trump, if he doesn’t win the primary, from running as a third party candidate.”\n  \n\n      He then, perhaps inadvertently, spelled out why the 2024 version of the pledge would be doomed from the start.\n  \n\n      “We did (have loyalty oaths) in 2016, they weren’t effective, they weren’t enforceable,” Hutchinson said. “You had candidates who participated in the debate who later didn’t support the nominee of the party.”\n  \n\n      That nominee, of course, was Trump.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nDonald Trump, the first former president in history to face criminal charges, arrived in New York Monday for an expected arraignment on Tuesday after being indicted last week by a Manhattan grand jury. \n  \n\n      The expected voluntary surrender of a former president and 2024 White House candidate will be a unique affair in more ways than one – both for the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the New York courthouse where he’ll be arraigned and for a nation watching to see how it’ll shake up the GOP presidential primary.\n  \n\n      Trump’s mood was described by an adviser on Monday as “defiant and focused,” as he watched expansive television coverage during his flight back to his native New York City from Florida. The former president has remained “surprisingly calm,” spending the weekend in Florida playing golf and mulling how to use it to boost his campaign, CNN reported Sunday night, after an indictment that caught him and his advisers “off guard.”\n  \n\n      Trump faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud, CNN has reported, but the indictment remains under seal.\n  \n\n      The Manhattan district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump in connection with his alleged role in a hush money payment scheme and cover-up involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election. Trump and his allies have already attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg – and an advertised Tuesday night speech back at Mar-a-Lago will likely give Trump more opportunity to claim he’s being political persecuted.\n  \n\n      Here is what we know about the expected arraignment.\n  \n\n      Trump left Florida shortly after noon ET on Monday and landed at New York’s LaGuardia airport around 3:30 p.m. ET. The former president will stay at Trump Tower Monday night and is expected to depart New York immediately after Tuesday’s arraignment to head back to Florida, the source said. \n  \n\n      But even before Trump’s appearance, his presence will be felt in the Manhattan courthouse Tuesday, as all trials and most other court activity is being halted before he is slated to arrive.\n  \n\n      The Secret Service, the New York Police Department and the court officers are coordinating security for Trump’s expected appearance. The Secret Service is scheduled to accompany Trump in the early afternoon to the district attorney’s office, which is in the same building as the courthouse.\n  \n\n      Trump will be booked by the investigators, which includes taking his fingerprints. Ordinarily, a mug shot would be taken. But sources familiar with the preparations were uncertain as to whether there would be a mugshot – because Trump’s appearance is widely known and authorities were concerned about the improper leaking of the photo, which would be a violation of state law.\n  \n\n      Typically, after defendants are arrested, they are booked and held in cells near the courtroom before they are arraigned. But that won’t happen with Trump. Once the former president is finished being processed, he’ll be taken through a back set of hallways and elevators to the floor where the courtroom is located. He’ll then come out to a public hallway to walk into the courtroom.\n  \n\n      Trump is not expected to be handcuffed, as he will be surrounded by armed federal agents for his protection.  \n  \n\n      “Obviously, this is different. This has never happened before. I have never had Secret Service involved in an arraignment before at 100 Centre Street,” Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “All the Tuesday stuff is still very much up in the air, other than the fact that we will very loudly and proudly say not guilty.”\n  \n\n      By the afternoon, Trump is expected to be brought to the courtroom, where the indictment will be unsealed and he will formally face the charges. After he is arraigned, Trump will almost certainly be released on his own recognizance. It is possible, though perhaps unlikely, that conditions could be set on his travel.  \n  \n\n      Ordinarily, a defendant who is released would walk out the front doors, but Secret Service will want to limit the time and space where Trump is in public. So instead, once the court hearing is over, Trump is expected to walk again through the public hallway and into the back corridors to the district attorney’s office, back to where his motorcade will be waiting.\n  \n\n      Then he’ll head to the airport so he can get back to Mar-a-Lago, where he’s scheduled an event that evening to speak publicly.\n  \n\n      Trump’s arraignment will not be broadcast live, a New York judge said Monday night. \n  \n\n      The judge, Juan Merchan, rejected a request by several media outlets, including CNN, asking him for permission to broadcast Trump’s expected appearance in the courtroom on Tuesday. However, he ruled five still photographers will be allowed to take pictures of Trump and the courtroom before the hearing begins.\n  \n\n      The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal were among the outlets making the request — which also asked the judge to unseal the indictment.\n  \n\n      The news organizations asked for a “limited number of photographers, videographers, and radio journalists to be present at the arraignment,” and said in the letter that they are making “this limited request for audio-visual coverage in order to ensure that the operations of the Court will not be disrupted in any way.”\n  \n\n      While he rejected the request to broadcast the arraignment, Merchan acknowledged the historical significance of the proceeding.\n  \n\n      “That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past President been indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Trump’s arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention,” he wrote. “The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.”\n  \n\n      Merchan said that while the media’s request was understandable, the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”\n  \n\n      The Manhattan district attorney’s office did not taken a position on whether to allow cameras in the courtroom. Trump’s legal team has cited security concerns in arguing against allowing them.\n  \n\n      If the judge does not grant the media outlets’ unsealing request, it is expected that the indictment will be made public when Trump appears in court.\n  \n\nJudge Juan Merchan is no stranger to Trump’s orbit. \n  \n\n      Merchan, an acting New York Supreme Court justice, has sentenced Trump’s close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison, presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial and overseen former adviser Steve Bannon’s criminal fraud case.\n  \n\n      Merchan does not stand for disruptions or delays, attorneys who have appeared before him told CNN, and he’s known to maintain control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention.\n  \n\n      Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore said during an interview Friday on CNN that Merchan was “not easy” on him when he tried a case before him but that he will likely be fair.\n  \n\n      “I’ve tried a case in front of him before. He could be tough. I don’t think it’s necessarily going to be something that’s going to change his ability to evaluate the facts and the law in this case,” Parlatore said.\n  \n\n      Tacopina told CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday that the former president will plead not guilty. His team “will look at every potential issue that we will be able to challenge, and we will challenge,” Tacopina said.\n  \n\n      The Trump team’s court strategy could center around challenging the case because it may rely on business record entries that prosecutors tie to hush money payments to Daniels seven years ago, beyond the statute of limitations for a criminal case. Tacopina suggested in TV interviews Sunday the statute of limitations may have passed, and said the Trump businesses didn’t make false entries.\n  \n\n      Trump’s legal team isn’t currently considering asking to move the case to a different New York City borough, Tacopina said. “There’s been no discussion of that whatsoever,” he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in another interview Sunday. “It’s way too premature to start worrying about venue changes until we really see the indictment and grapple with the legal issues.”\n  \n\n      Multiple sources told CNN on Monday that Trump has hired a new attorney, Todd Blanche, to serve as lead counsel in his defense.\n  \n\n      Blanche most recently was a partner at law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and previously represented former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Igor Fruman, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani’s and a key figure in Trump’s first impeachment trial.\n  \n\n      Tacopina and Susan Necheles will remain as lawyers on Trump’s legal team.\n  \n\n      Blanche’s hiring has been seen by some inside Trump’s orbit as a sidelining of Tacopina, who up until this point has been one of the most forward-facing attorneys dealing with Trump’s defense in the Manhattan DA’s case. However, a senior adviser to Trump pushed back on that characterization and said the addition of Blanche was intended to add more legal firepower to Trump’s defense.\n  \n\nTrump’s political advisers over the weekend were actively discussing how to best campaign off the indictment they have portrayed as a political hoax and witch hunt, according to sources close to Trump. \n  \n\n      His team has spent the last several days presenting the former president with polls showing him with a growing lead over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, currently considered Trump’s biggest 2024 rival, in a head-to-head match up. And his team says it has raised $7 million dollars since he was indicted Thursday.\n  \n\n      Despite the initial shock of the indictment, Trump has remained surprisingly calm and focused in the days ahead of his court appearance, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported. \n  \n\n      The former president has seemingly saved his rage for his social media site, escalating his attacks on Bragg and leveling threats. \n  \n\n      Many of Trump’s allies, critics and likely opponents in the 2024 Republican presidential primary race have similarly attacked Bragg before and after the indictment. \n  \n\n      But former Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who announced his presidential campaign on Sunday, doubled down on his call for Trump to drop out of the race now that he is facing criminal charges.\n  \n\n      “The office is more important than any individual person. So for the sake of the office of the presidency, I do think that’s too much of a sideshow and distraction,” Hutchinson said in an interview on ABC News. “He needs to be able to concentrate on his due process.”\n  \n\n      Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides said, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former president to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case, CNN’s Jeff Zeleny reported. \n  \n\n      But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense against the New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a primetime address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.\n  \n\n      It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vastly different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked.\n  \n\n      “He’s taking this very seriously and following legal advice,” an adviser to Trump said Monday night. “He will make his case to Americans Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago.”\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\n\n\n  CNN’s Kara Scannell, John Miller, Jeremy Herb, Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed, Jeff Zeleny, Sydney Kashiwagi, Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes, Holmes Lybrand, Hannah Rabinowitz, Paula Reid, Alayna Treene, Gregory Clary and Devan Cole contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nEditor’s Note: James Wigderson is the former editor of RightWisconsin.com, a conservative-leaning news website, and the author of a twice-weekly newsletter, “Life, Under Construction.” The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n\n      In every tale of the Faustian bargain, there is the moment when the devil collects his payment. For former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly, that moment came when he lost the election that would have put him back on the court and preserved a 4-3 conservative majority.\n  \n\n      Instead, Kelly lost to Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Janet Protasiewicz by over 10% in Tuesday’s election to fill a vacancy on the state’s highest court that will be left by the impending retirement of conservative Justice Patience “Pat” Roggensack.\n  \n\n      By Wisconsin standards, it was a blowout. It’s the first time liberals will have a majority on the state Supreme Court since 2008.\n  \n\n      On Wednesday, former President Donald Trump offered his explanation for why Kelly lost.\n  \n\n      “Daniel Kelly of Wisconsin just lost his Supreme Court Election,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “He bragged that he won’t seek Trump’s Endorsement, so I didn’t give it — which guaranteed his loss. How foolish is a man that doesn’t seek an Endorsement that would have won him the Election?”\n  \n\n      Just sign here in blood and you will get everything your heart desires.\n  \n\n      However, this was Kelly’s second loss since April 2020. Trump failed to mention that Kelly lost his seat on the court three years ago — with an endorsement from Trump. While Kelly may have tried a different tactic this time around, he has been irrevocably associated with Trump, having advised the Republican Party of Wisconsin on the 2020 election, including the decision to have fake Republican electors meet secretly in the state Capitol to falsely claim Wisconsin voted for Trump. \n  \n\nOpinion: Idaho's new abortion law is first to challenge the right to travel\n\n\n      Kelly also harshly criticized fellow conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn for occasionally siding with the liberals on the court on issues such as the state’s pandemic response, redistricting and even blocking Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, a 4-3 decision backed by Hagedorn and the three current liberals on the court.\n  \n\n      Then Kelly toured the state for the Republican Party, speaking on “election integrity” at events closed to the press.\n  \n\n      If being close to Trump would help a statewide candidate in Wisconsin, Kelly would have easily won. Instead, Protasiewicz used part of her fundraising advantage to attack Kelly for his ties to Trump and the Republican Party.\n  \n\n      At stake in Tuesday’s election was more than a 10-year term on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. As Protasiewicz made clear during her campaign, the election was a referendum on the state’s 1849 abortion ban and the lines of the legislative districts redrawn after the last census to lock in Republican majorities in the state legislature.\n  \n\n      Following the Democratic Party playbook since Roe v. Wade was overturned, Protasiewicz hammered Kelly on the airwaves over his endorsements from the state’s pro-life organizations while telling voters that she personally supported a woman’s right to an abortion.\n  \n\n      The Protasiewicz campaign strategy worked. Her victory continued an electoral trend in Wisconsin, with the continued erosion of support for Republican candidates in the suburban counties surrounding Milwaukee in the age of Trump.\n  \n\nOpinion: Expulsion of the 'Tennessee Three' is a chilling echo of Jim Crow\n\n\n      If Republicans are going to reverse their fortunes in these suburban counties, they’re going to have to settle the abortion issue. According to the Marquette University Law School poll, the majority of independent voters remains consistently opposed to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe. Those independent voters, especially women, are now pulling the lever for the Democrats.\n  \n\n      But Republicans are also going to have to end the blood contract with Trump. The trend of Republicans losing suburban votes began before Roe v. Wade was overturned. As recently as 2012, the Republican margins of victory in presidential elections in the three counties to the north and west of Milwaukee County were 40.1% in Washington County, 34.5% in Waukesha County and 30.3% in Ozaukee County, according to Craig Gilbert in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. By 2020, those margins of victory had dropped to 38.1% in Washington County, 20.9% in Waukesha County and just 12% in Ozaukee County.\n  \n\n      Those three counties, collectively known as the WOW counties, once provided enough votes for Republican statewide candidates to offset the Democrats’ advantage in Milwaukee County.\n  \n\n      But since the appearance of Trump in 2016, the Republican advantage has been evaporating. Ozaukee County, Milwaukee County’s northern neighbor along the lakefront, is now almost evenly split with Kelly winning just 52% of the vote, down 11% from what the last successful conservative Supreme Court justice received in that county in 2019.\n  \n\n      Kelly even lost the city of Waukesha (49.7%), my hometown, which the conservative Hagedorn won with 60.6% of the vote in 2019.\n  \n\n      In 2022, businessman Tim Michels ran for governor after seeking Trump’s endorsement and even agreeing with the former president that the election was stolen. Michels lost by 3.3%.\n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin just managed to squeak out an election victory in 2022 with a 1% margin over a very weak Democratic opponent after attempting to minimize what happened on January 6 and criticizing any investigation of Trump. (Johnson may have been saved by his new position on abortion, calling for limits to be decided in a statewide referendum.)\n  \n\n      As long as the Trump drama continues and he continues to lead the race for the Republican nomination for president, Wisconsin’s suburban voters will continue to punish the state Republican Party’s candidates with ties to the former president. The Republican Party of Wisconsin may well regret hosting the national convention in 2024 if Trump is the nominee again.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "content": "\n      Stormy Daniels is “absolutely” willing to testify in Donald Trump’s New York criminal trial, she said in an interview with Piers Morgan, her first comments since the former president pleaded not guilty to charges related to a hush-money payment scheme intended to silence the adult film star. \n  \n\n      “Having them call me in and put me on the stand legitimizes my story and who I am. And if they don’t, it almost feels like they’re hiding me,” Daniels told TalkTV’s Morgan in an interview that aired Thursday. “And people automatically assume – I would – that, ‘Oh, she must not be a good witness, she’s not credible.’”   \n  \n\n      “So there’s no doubt, if they ask you to testify, you will testify?” Morgan asked Daniels.\n  \n\n      “Oh, absolutely,” she replied. \n  \n\nStormy Daniels ordered to pay Trump team another $120,000 in legal fees \n\n\n      Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in Manhattan criminal court on Tuesday. Prosecutors alleged that that the crimes were committed as part of a scheme to cover up money paid to Daniels in the days leading up to the 2016 election to keep her from going public about an affair she said she had with Trump. \n  \n\n      Trump has denied the alleged affair. Daniels is not accused of any wrongdoing.\n  \n\n      In the interview aired Thursday, Daniels also said she doesn’t think Trump should serve jail time if he’s convicted in the case. The felony charges brought against Trump carry a sentence of a minimum of one year and as much as four years, though if convicted, Trump could be sentenced to probation. \n  \n\n      “Specific to my case, I don’t think that his crimes against me are worthy of incarceration,” she told Morgan.\n  \n\n      And she described how she felt when she saw Trump in court on Tuesday, telling Morgan: “The king has been dethroned, he’s no longer untouchable.” \n  \n\n      “And nobody should be untouchable. It doesn’t matter what your job description is, whether you’re the president. Like you should be held responsible for your actions,” she said. \n  \n\n      Though Daniels had not testified before the grand jury that investigated the hush-money scheme, she said in 2021 that she would “love nothing more than” to be interviewed as part of the probe. \n  \n\nWhy New York's hush money case against Donald Trump is viewed as risky \n\n\n      Daniels said at the time that her attorney had been in contact with Manhattan and New York state investigators and that she has had meetings with them about other issues. She said if she were asked to talk to investigators or a grand jury she would “tell them everything I know.”\n  \n\n      She wrote a tell-all book in 2018 that described the alleged affair in graphic detail, with her then-attorney saying that the book was intended to prove her story about having sex with Trump is true.\n  \n\n      Daniels told Morgan that threats aimed at her from Trump supporters are now “way more specific and graphic,” and much more serious than they were in the past.  \n  \n\n      “They’re a lot more passionate – I guess that’s a good word. Enthusiastic with their threats. And they’re not hiding. And they genuinely feel that they are doing something right. That they are the patriots,” Daniels said.\n  \n\n      “Now they are doing it like a suicide bomber. They truly … in the depths of their soul, they feel like they are doing the right thing,” she added. \n  \n\n      Part of the change, she said, is that people making the threats are doing so from their real phone numbers, emails and social media accounts, instead of anonymously.  \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Here’s what we knowTakeaways and key lines from the indictmentREAD the full indictment and statement of factsFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment addressWho is Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA leading the historic criminal case?\n\n      Pomerantz resigned from the Manhattan DA’s office in 2022 and said in his resignation letter that former President was “guilty of numerous felony violations” in connection to his annual financial statements. He resigned one day after Bragg informed him that he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges at that point. \n  \n\n      The committee wrote in a statement announcing the subpoena that, “Pomerantz’s public statements about the investigation strongly suggest that Bragg’s prosecution of President Trump is politically motivated.”\n  \n\n      Bragg responded to news of the subpoena by saying “the House GOP continues to attempt to undermine an active investigation and ongoing New York criminal case with an unprecedented campaign of harassment and intimidation.” \n  \n\n      The statement posted to Twitter went on to say, “These elected officials would better serve their constituents and the country, and fulfill their oath of office, by doing their jobs in Congress and not intruding on the sovereignty of the state of New York by interfering in an ongoing criminal matter in state court.”\n  \n\n      Pomerantz declined to comment when asked about the subpoena. \n  \n\n      Jordan first requested Pomerantz to cooperate voluntarily on March 22, but said Pomerantz advised that the New York County District Attorney’s Office had directed him not to cooperate. \n  \n\n      The deposition date has been set for April 20, according to a copy of the subpoena reviewed by CNN.\n  \n\nNext steps in the Donald Trump criminal case\n\n\n      Jordan telegraphed his decision to subpoena Pomerantz in an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday by saying, “we think we’d like to talk to him and start to get some answers. That may be an easier route to pursue initially than Mr. Bragg.” Bragg’s office has responded to Jordan’s requests and has said they are willing to meet. \n  \n\n      The subpoena to Pomerantz is the latest subpoena that Jordan has fired off as chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. Jordan evaded a congressional subpoena when the former January 6 committee subpoenaed him in the last Congress as part of its investigation.\n  \n\n      In the subpoena letter, Jordan writes that because of Pomerantz’s book and public media appearances, he has “no basis to decline to testify about matters before the Committee.”\n  \n\n      “Just this month, you published a book excoriating Bragg for not aggressively prosecuting President Trump, laying bare the office’s internal deliberations about the investigation and your personal animus toward President Trump,” Jordan wrote.\n  \n\n      “It now appears that your efforts to shame Bragg have worked as he is reportedly resurrecting a so-called “zombie” case against President Trump using a tenuous and untested legal theory,” he added. “Your book again unfairly disparaged President Trump, and now opens the door to examination about the District Attorney’s office commitment to evenhanded justice.”\n  \n\n      Jordan also says that Congress “may consider legislative reforms to the authorities of special counsels and their relationships with other prosecuting entities.”\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n\n  CNN’s Kara Scannell contributed. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Here’s what we knowTakeaways and key lines from the indictmentREAD the full indictment and statement of factsFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment addressWho is Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA leading the historic criminal case?\n\nTrump was indicted related to a hush money payment scheme probe. Here’s what we knowTakeaways and key lines from the indictmentREAD the full indictment and statement of factsFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment addressWho is Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA leading the historic criminal case?\n\n      Both of those worst-of-all-worlds scenarios came true on a day that Trump described as “SURREAL” in a social media post sent as he motorcaded to court to turn himself in. The result is that another grim and even tragic chapter may lie ahead for a country that is still far from working through the fallout from Trump’s single term as it girds for yet another bitter election.One of the most portentous days in American legal history began with the ex-president leaving his skyscraper home in the city where he found fame as a real estate shark and tabloid-filling celebrity but that was now set to place him under arrest.\n  \n\n      Trump walked slowly through the door of the courthouse and was taken to be fingerprinted. News photographs of the once-most-powerful man in the world – with a face like thunder, seated at a table with lawyers like any other defendant – reflected his moment of stunning indignity.\n  \n\n      Trump kept silent in court, saying little other than “not guilty,” and he didn’t speak to reporters after the hearing. But by the time he swapped the spartan decor of the courtroom for friendly turf, under the crystal chandeliers in his gold-leafed resort in Florida, Trump was ready to erupt.\n  \n\n      “Our country’s gone to Hell,” he declared, in a rambling tirade bursting with conspiracy theories that also expanded into an angry rant against prosecutors in other, potentially more serious investigations than the one in Manhattan.\n  \n\n      His furious reaction to those cases showed he is increasingly worried about his vulnerability as prosecutors in separate investigations probe his bid to steal Joe Biden’s election win in Georgia in 2020, his hoarding of classified documents and his behavior ahead of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. But it also pointed to the fact that with several investigations apparently close to wrapping up, there is a possibility that Trump could soon face even more indictments. \n  \n\n      Given that the next hearing in the Manhattan case is on December 4, and the other cases appear to address more grave constitutional questions, it’s possible that Tuesday’s events could well be overtaken. The day a former president was charged with a crime will always be remembered, but it might come to be seen as the start of an ominous process for Trump more than a historic culmination.\n  \n\nBragg’s case rests on the simple and vital premise that no one – not even an ex-president with his sights on the White House again – should be above the law. But the district attorney’s critics are concerned that another equally and opposing principle is at play – whether someone who is famous, rich and powerful is being prosecuted while a less notorious person might be let go.\n  \n\n      “The defendant Donald J. Trump repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election,” read the statement of facts that accompanied the indictment.\n  \n\n      The charging documents say that Trump and his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, worked with American Media Inc. to make payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal as well to a doorman at Trump Tower. Hush money payouts are not illegal. But Bragg, a Democrat, alleges that Trump falsified business records to hide the payments. Normally, such transgressions would be mere misdemeanors. But Bragg suggested that a felony can be charged if the books were cooked to hide evidence of criminal conduct connected to the 2016 campaign. \n  \n\nTakeaways and key lines from the indictment against Donald Trump \n\n\n      Trump’s behavior detailed in court documents and in a previous case involving Cohen was certainly sleazy. But some legal analysts pointed out that Bragg’s legal roadmap could open the way to robust pre-trial motions by Trump’s attorneys.\n  \n\n      Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told CNN Tuesday evening that there was “disappointment” among his fellow veteran law enforcement officers that the Bragg indictment and statement of facts had not been more specific on the leap required to charge Trump with a felony.\n  \n\n      “Everyone was hoping we would see more about the direction that they intend to take this prosecution, what is the legal theory that ties that very solid misdemeanor case … to the intent to conceal another crime?” McCabe said.\n  \n\n      “At the end of the day, if all of our legal friends read this indictment and don’t see a way to a felony, it’s hard to imagine convincing a jury that they should get there.”\n  \n\n      Still, Bragg insisted that a decision not to prosecute Trump would go against every core principle of American justice.\n  \n\n      “We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct,” he said at a news conference after Trump appeared in court. He said such cases were not unusual, but “the bread and butter” of his office’s work.\n  \n\n      “At its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white collar cases. Allegations that someone lied again, and again, to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable,” Bragg said.\n  \n\n      The apparent complexity of the legal case will play out in court. But it will also have important political reverberations, given Trump’s status as a former president who is seeking to win back the White House in 2024.\n  \n\n      If it is hard even for lawyers to follow the reasoning behind Bragg’s case, it will be harder for everyone else to do so. Many may question whether falsifying business records to cover up an alleged affair from years before the 2016 election, which now feels long ago, truly justifies the politically radioactive step of charging an ex-president for the first time in America’s history. (Trump has denied the affair.)\n  \n\nNotable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023\n\n\n      The sense that the Bragg indictment could rebound against the district attorney and benefit Trump politically was captured by some Republicans who do not support the former president – like former Trump national security adviser John Bolton in an appearance on CNN. Another Trump critic, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, also criticized the case.\n  \n\n      “I believe President Trump’s character and conduct make him unfit for office. Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda,” Romney said.\n  \n\n      Like any American in his position, Trump should have the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Unlike many other defendants, he can have every legal resource at his disposal and try to mount an attempt to dismiss the case before it reaches a possible trial.\n  \n\n      But he’s not waiting.\n  \n\n      After getting a hero’s welcome at home in Mar-a-Lago, he unleashed a tirade that bristled with falsehoods about the investigations against him, Biden’s presidency and his term in office. He renewed the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him and styled Bragg’s investigation and others as an attempt to fix another election.\n  \n\nFact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment address \n\n\n      “They can’t beat us at the ballot box so they try and beat us through the law,” he claimed in a speech in which he also alleged the judge in the Manhattan case and his wife were “Trump hating.” The ex-president’s logic was often difficult to follow and he shouted certain words for emphasis in a way that expressed his fury. But while rambling, Trump opened another window into one of the most sinister aspects of the invective reminiscent of his “American carnage” inaugural speech.\n  \n\n      By seeking to destroy trust in institutions that seek to constrain his behavior, and claiming he is the victim of political persecution, he is following the playbook of some of the world’s most notorious demagogues. Trump’s talent for such propaganda is underscored by the way that he has convinced millions of his supporters that the last election was corrupt.\n  \n\n      Some political pundits have predicted that Trump’s indictment could help him politically, at least in the short term. His campaign has said fundraising dollars have been pouring in since the grand jury voted to indict him last week. And Trump’s opponents and potential rivals for the GOP nomination have had little choice but to line up and criticize Bragg over his actions if they want to avoid alienating Trump’s base. \n  \n\n      But months ahead of the GOP primary, it’s impossible to know how Tuesday’s events will play out. Past evidence suggests that the more extreme Trump gets, the more popular he becomes with base voters. \n  \n\n      But the past also has less favorable political lessons for the ex-president. The extremism that he displayed on Tuesday night to a primetime television audience was exactly the brand of radicalism that contributed to disappointing Republican finishes in the 2020 election and the 2022 midterms.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has a message for his fellow Republicans looking to win back the White House: “We cannot get distracted.”\n  \n\n      “We have to tell people, No. 1, what we’re for. No. 2, that we’re going to be focused on the future and what we’re going to do for the voters in our state or the American people. And then, No. 3, we have to do a simple thing: We have to win,” Kemp told CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday on “State of the Union.”\n  \n\n      The governor’s remarks came a day after he’d told donors at a Republican National Committee retreat in Nashville that the GOP needed to move on from the 2020 presidential election. In his speech, Kemp offered a thinly veiled dig at former President Donald Trump and his continued election grievances, without naming him, saying, “Not a single swing voter will vote for our nominee if they choose to talk about the 2020 election being stolen.”\n  \n\n      Trump, currently seen as the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, has repeatedly argued since leaving office that Republicans cannot succeed – either at the ballot box or legislatively – if they turn a blind eye to the past. But candidates who backed his false election claims did poorly in the midterm elections last fall in key swing states Trump will need to win back the White House in 2024. \n  \n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp urges Republicans to move on from election fraud claims: '2020 is ancient history'\n\n\n      Trump is also under a cloud of legal woes. In New York, a hush money payment to an adult-film star shortly before the 2016 election has resulted in his  indictment by a Manhattan grand jury over his alleged role in the scheme. And in Atlanta, a select grand jury has investigated efforts by Trump and allies to overturn his election loss in Georgia in 2020. \n  \n\n      “I can’t control what the judicial branch is doing or what a local prosecutor is doing in many ways, but what we can control … is what we’re focused on,” Kemp said Sunday. \n  \n\n      “If we get distracted and talk about other things that the Democrats want to talk about, like these investigations – regardless of what you think about the politics of those – if we get distracted every day and let the media just talk about that, that only helps Joe Biden,” he added. “It does not give us a path for Republicans to win.”\n  \n\n      Asked by Tapper if Trump was unelectable nationwide, Kemp demurred.\n  \n\n      “That’s for the people to decide,” he said.\n  \n\n      Tension between Trump and Kemp has been simmering for years. When Kemp refused to overturn Biden’s 2020 win in Georgia, Trump made the governor his No. 1 enemy, publicly railing against him throughout 2021 and recruiting former US Sen. David Perdue to challenge Kemp in a GOP primary. Through it all, Trump failed to draw Kemp into a fight, and the governor won his 2022 primary overwhelmingly before handily defeating Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams in the November general election.\n  \n\n      Kemp said Sunday that Republicans will need to draw a distinction with what he referred to as “the disaster of the Biden administration” to win next year, pointing to border security, high inflation and energy policy. \n  \n\n      “I think we’re going to have a lot of good candidates that, if they focus on those things, we have got a great chance of winning the White House in 2024,” the governor said. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      While Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis held a meet-and-greet on Capitol Hill Tuesday evening, former President Donald Trump and his team aimed to be one step ahead – planning a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort with members of the Florida congressional delegation just two days after the DeSantis reception.\n  \n\n      Thursday’s dinner, which was described to CNN by multiple GOP sources, is the latest bid by Trump to court support from their shared home turf as the former president tries to show strength amid his mounting legal troubles and tweak his likely rival in the 2024 race. \n  \n\n      The intense battle for Sunshine State endorsements kicked into overdrive this week: in the 24 hours ahead of DeSantis’s visit to Washington, three Florida Republicans – Reps. Greg Steube, John Rutherford and Brian Mast – officially announced their support for Trump, while DeSantis locked down his first Florida endorsement, his third overall, from Rep. Laurel Lee.\n  \n\n      For Trump, securing as many congressional endorsements as possible – particularly from Florida – before DeSantis formally declares his candidacy has been a top personal priority, according to multiple sources close to the former president.  \n  \n\n      “We want to be able to show that even members in DeSantis’ own state, who know and work with him, don’t support him for president,” a source close to the Trump campaign told CNN.\n  \n\n      The two men have approached the competition for endorsements differently, a reflection of their contrasting styles. Trump has been directly involved in lobbying members to get on board with his presidential bid, as have some of his advisers and top surrogates both on and off Capitol Hill. Even Trump-supporting Republican consultants spent days working the phones on the former president’s behalf. \n  \n\n      Trump’s team is keeping close tabs on who is – and isn’t – endorsing him, and is expected to roll out more endorsements from the Florida delegation this week.\n  \n\n      Florida Rep. Vern Buchanan endorsed Trump on Wednesday, the eighth Florida Republican to back the former president over their home state governor, DeSantis.\n  \n\n      According to a source, Trump personally called Buchanan for the endorsement and invited Buchanan to dinner at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night. Trump endorsed Buchanan ahead of his primary in 2022.\n  \n\n      DeSantis, meanwhile, has only started the process of making critical inroads with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, with his team reaching out to some members and the governor meeting directly with members at the reception in Washington, though more lawmakers are expected to throw their support behind him once he officially gets in the race. \n  \n\n      Endorsements, however, aren’t necessarily an indicator of performance in the race or future success. And while Trump has racked up more so far, DeSantis hasn’t formally announced a presidential bid yet, making their track records difficult to compare.\n  \n\n      Still, DeSantis has his work cut out for him given Trump’s head start, previous relationships and early maneuvering. By the time Texas Rep. Lance Gooden walked into the meeting with DeSantis on Capitol Hill Tuesday, he had already privately indicated to Trump associates he would be backing the former president in 2024 — which he announced in a planned statement moments after leaving the event. The episode is one of many that illustrates the level at which Trump’s team is working to try and stay one step ahead of the Florida governor.\n  \n\n      “I met with Governor DeSantis, and while he has done commendable work in Florida, there is no doubt in my mind that President Trump is the only leader who can save America from the leftist onslaught we are currently facing,” Gooden said in a statement.\n  \n\n      Most lawmakers, however, are keeping their powder dry for now, worried about potential blowback from the notoriously vengeful Trump or crossing their powerful home state governor. One Florida lawmaker, describing the pressure they’re facing to pick a side, told CNN: “People are torn. We still have to govern. We have things we need from the state for our districts.”\n  \n\n      Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who was the second GOP lawmaker to back DeSantis, alluded to those fears, saying of the lawmakers attending Tuesday’s meet-and-greet, it “doesn’t mean they’re endorsing. It just means they’re not scared to talk.”\n  \n\n      Trump’s team is being very deliberate about its outreach for endorsements, his advisers tell CNN, and is hyper focused on securing endorsements in states that are important to the presidential primary calendar, such as South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, in addition to his home state of Florida.\n  \n\n      Trump is personally engaging lawmakers – especially those he has previously endorsed – and has spoken directly with each member prior to their endorsement, two sources familiar with the process tell CNN. \n  \n\n      “He’s applying a very personal touch to securing endorsements for the campaign,” one of the sources said. “We’re competing for every endorsement in every state. He’s spent nearly a decade developing relationships and working to help elect Republicans to office. And calling upon those relationships and leveraging those relationships has led to the endorsement success that you’ve seen over the past few weeks.” \n  \n\n      Trump and his team have said they understand that there are a number of hurdles the former president has to overcome this election cycle, including winning over skeptical voters and lawmakers. But his team believes he has an advantage when he connects directly with people.\n  \n\n      “Trump can be very charming when he wants to be. People forget that,” one former Trump adviser previously told CNN. \n  \n\n      Trump’s top advisers – including Susie Wiles, who runs the former president’s political operation, and Brian Jack, who helped managed Trump’s congressional relationships as his former White House political director and now advises both Trump and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – have been making calls regarding endorsements on Trump’s behalf, his advisers tell CNN.\n  \n\n      Top allies on the Hill have also engaged in outreach. House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik – a fierce and early supporter of Trump – is intensely lobbying Republican members of Congress to formally back the former president. Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, Trump’s former chief medical adviser while in office, and Florida Rep. Cory Mills have both been working members in their respective states as well to quietly shore up support at an early stage.\n  \n\n      “I’m going to try to lead the fight on the Texas side, from a congressional aspect at least,” Jackson said.\n  \n\n      At least two Republican consultants close to the Trump campaign with clients on Capitol Hill were also working on behalf of the former president to firm up support from members. \n  \n\n      Many of the conversations from Trump’s team, his Hill supporters and outside Republican consultants have centered on reminding lawmakers that Trump helped them get elected, multiple sources familiar with the conversations tell CNN, and that Trump can help them in the future. Trump and his team have been especially focused on the members he endorsed in the past and the former president expects them to return the favor.\n  \n\n      Trump and his surrogates are using a typical Trump-style, loyalty-centric pitch, acknowledging that while it’s still early in the 2024 presidential cycle, Trump will remember the people who supported him while the primary field was still uncertain. They have argued that he is leading in polls and will ultimately be the GOP nominee, so it’s smart for them to endorse now, according to members who have been lobbied on this front.\n  \n\n      While Trump’s team is expected to roll out more Florida endorsements in the coming days, some lawmakers are keeping their options open. Several Florida members, including Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar, Kat Cammack and Mario Diaz-Balart, have coyly avoided an endorsement, only telling reporters they’re sure the next president will be from the Sunshine State.\n  \n\nDeSantis goes to Washington, a place he once despised, looking for support to take on Trump\n\n\n      Unlike Trump – who received near-universal support from Hill Republicans while president – DeSantis has built fewer relationships on Capitol Hill despite serving for six years in Congress, where he was known as more of a loner. \n  \n\n      But DeSantis earned goodwill traveling the country last cycle to help GOP candidates in contested battlegrounds, while Republicans picked up four seats in Florida on election night thanks to the Florida governor’s unprecedented role in the drawing of Florida’s new congressional map.\n  \n\n      Massie told CNN that he had been hearing from GOP colleagues who were interested in getting to know DeSantis better, and so he suggested the idea of a meet-and-greet. And DeSantis, who has been under increasing pressure to prove he has the juice to take on Trump, was receptive to the idea.\n  \n\n      Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who became the first Republican to endorse DeSantis and helped host Tuesday’s event, said the governor “has a whole lot of support from a whole lot of people who have said they support the president publicly.”\n  \n\n      Dozens of GOP lawmakers and conservative leaders flowed in and out of DeSantis’s closed-door reception at the Heritage Foundation – a meeting that was widely viewed as a key step ahead of DeSantis’s expected 2024 presidential campaign launch. \n  \n\n      DeSantis was coy about his future presidential ambitions and did not divulge details of when he might formally enter the race, multiple Republican lawmakers told CNN as they left the event, but he admitted in private conversations with members that he’s seriously considering launching a bid.\n  \n\n      “He’s done a great job as governor. He’s a significant Republican leader, and we will see if he is going to enter the presidential,” Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania told CNN. “He alluded to the idea that he’s giving it real consideration.”\n  \n\n      DeSantis kicked off the event with brief remarks about the policies he’s enacted and implemented in Florida and reminisced about the days when he was still a member of the House – remarks he reiterated a few times throughout the meeting – before mingling with individual lawmakers, members told CNN.\n  \n\n      “I think he’s America’s governor. He’s done an outstanding job and the people of Florida rewarded him with a 20-point win. He’s an example to everybody,” Rep. Bob Good of Virginia told CNN.\n  \n\n      While many members consistently lauded DeSantis and his work in Florida, they also declined to offer their endorsement of him – at least this early on – telling CNN they plan to reserve their judgment until later in the primary.\n  \n\n      “I’ve run many political campaigns. Endorsements by elected officials don’t mean a whole lot,” Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland said.\n  \n\n      “No, I’m not (endorsing) at this point,” said Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado. “It’s an honor to see him. And I think it’s great that he’s here … I think it’s going to be a good group of people who run that will give Republicans a good choice.”\n  \n\n      They also acknowledged that DeSantis has yet to formally announce a White House bid, so endorsing now is a bit premature. Privately, they admitted to CNN that such a move could land them in hot water with other candidates.\n  \n\n      “I don’t see the upside to endorsing right now. The field is still forming,” one House Republican lawmaker who attended the meeting told CNN on the condition of anonymity. “For now, I’ll attend meetings and wait and see.”\n  \n\n      More than two dozen House Republicans, in addition to Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and John Cornyn of Texas, attended DeSantis’s event.\n  \n\n      Some of DeSantis’ allies, meanwhile, are dismissing the significance of endorsements, suggesting they say more about the person endorsing than it does the candidate.\n  \n\n      Still, alarm bells went off inside DeSantis’ political circle when Florida Rep. Byron Donalds announced he was getting behind the former president earlier this month, just weeks after telling CNN he wouldn’t endorse until the field was set. \n  \n\n      That “sent shockwaves through the entire Florida delegation,” one GOP consultant close to one of those members said, because Donalds was considered the closest to DeSantis of any House Republican in the state. Donalds introduced DeSantis at his victory rally on election night last year. \n  \n\n      DeSantis’ team scrambled to try to convince Florida Republicans not to endorse until after he had formally decided to run, sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Ryan Tyson, a pollster within DeSantis’ tight inner circle, reached out to members of the delegation to arrange a phone call with the governor. \n  \n\n      However, DeSantis’ overtures were not particularly well received. Some were put off by DeSantis’s reluctant approach to courting their support. Two members of the delegation endorsed Trump after DeSantis’ team started making calls.  \n  \n\n      “If the governor wants the endorsement, he should be picking up the phone and calling directly instead of having an aide doing the reach out,” the source close to a House member said. “You know who calls for the Trump endorsement? Trump himself.”\n  \n\n      “He has people calling that no one has ever heard of,” another Republican Hill aide told CNN. \n  \n\n      Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee has also bristled at the governor’s more hands-off approach. He told CNN he unsuccessfully tried to get in contact with DeSantis through his team multiple times last year, but they have “blown me off.” Burchett also complained that he helped with a fundraiser for DeSantis in his district last year and they “left me off the list.”\n  \n\n      Yet Burchett said he has no ill feelings toward the governor and opted to attend the Hill reception, where Burchett finally got some face time with DeSantis – and even snapped a selfie with the governor.\n  \n\n      Still, Burchett said he has no intentions of officially picking sides, despite being contacted by Trump’s team and being a staunch Trump ally. \n  \n\n      “I don’t think you pick up friends – you just pick up enemies” by endorsing someone, Burchett said.\n  \n\n      DeSantis’ Hill backers say they aren’t worried about any potential punishment from Trump.\n  \n\n      “I don’t think he can afford to do that. Because there will be several of us. I know some people already who are in the wings. There’s just too many,” Massie told CNN. “And why should we get attacked for expressing a preference in a primary?”\n  \n\n      Roy, who broke with Trump over certifying the 2020 election, added: “It’s not the first time I’ve stepped into these waters.”\n  \n\n  CNN’s Steve Contorno and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Former President Donald Trump’s expected court appearance in New York on Tuesday has led to a modest outburst of online threats featuring calls for violence but US officials say the chatter has been disorganized, sporadic and lacks the coherent planning that defined the lead-up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.  \n  \n\n      Any signs of a spike in violent rhetoric or evolving potential threats are filtered through federal channels at the Department of Homeland Security and FBI, which are in regular contact with the New York Police Department as it makes security preparations for Trump’s arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse, a senior US official familiar with the planning told CNN.  \n  \n\n      “We’re definitely not ruling anything out and staying vigilant,” the official told CNN. “But we don’t see any active specific, credible plotting.”\n  \n\n      Still, current and former US national security and law enforcement officials interviewed by CNN are wary that far-right extremists are now more likely to use encrypted communications to plan their next move, rather than public message boards. These officials don’t want to make the mistake of underestimating the potential for political violence, as critics accused federal and state and local law enforcement of doing prior to January 6.  \n  \n\n      “The really sophisticated actors wouldn’t likely be talking in public forums anyway,” the senior official said.  \n  \n\n      Trump initially called for protests when he first posted about his potential arrest two weeks ago, but he hasn’t called specifically for supporters to come to New York on Tuesday since it was confirmed that he would be indicted.\n  \n\n      The New York Young Republican Club is organizing a demonstration near the court on Tuesday. A previous protest by the group in the area was poorly attended. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, says she will attend the protest and is calling on her supporters to join. \n  \n\n      Over the weekend, there were a handful of demonstrations by Trump supporters protesting the indictment in places including South Carolina and California. A 33-year-old man was arrested after a fight broke out on Saturday during a protest by a small group of Trump supporters in Huntington Beach, California.  \n  \n\n      Publicly, there has been a steady stream of violent rhetoric surrounding the arraignment with some focus on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. One user on a pro-Trump forum reacting to Bragg’s push to indict Trump: “There once was a time when he would have been lynched for much less.” \n  \n\n      Despite this, there seems to be little public discussion about actually attending the event. And a constant theme on pro-Trump message boards in recent weeks has been a fear that any protests may be a trap set by federal agents.    \n  \n\n      “Remember what happened last time Trump called for a protest? He threw everyone under the bus,” reads a post shared on a Telegram channel of the far-right Proud Boys group. \n  \n\n      FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials have tried to strike a balance between staying vigilant for any emerging threats while also not making too much of online chatter and sharing false alarms with state and local officials. Federal agencies are also wary of opening themselves to political attacks from Republicans eager to call out anything perceived as infringing on people’s First Amendment rights, CNN has reported.   \n  \n\n      At the federal level, there is still a concern that information about potential threats the feds disseminate to state and local officials could be seen as fodder for conspiracy theorists that the government is plotting something against them, a source familiar with the planning told CNN.  \n  \n\n      Researchers, too, must balance keeping close track of inflammatory online chatter and not overplaying empty threats that would only add to public anxiety around Trump’s arraignment. \n  \n\n      This is in stark contrast to the days leading up to January 6, when Trump supporters discussed traveling to Washington, DC, after Trump called them to the city.  \n  \n\n      On pro-Trump forums there are fears that demonstrations may be a “set-up.” This is fueled in part by the false notion that many Trump supporters believe that the January 6 attack on the US Capitol was an “inside job” or the work of far left groups like “Antifa.” In reality, hundreds of Trump supporters have been charged for taking part in the attack on the Capitol.  \n  \n\n      “Unlike January 6, we are not seeing widespread discussions about logistical preparations for protests,” Adi Cohen, the chief operating officer of Memetica, an online threat intelligence company, told CNN on Sunday.  \n  \n\n      “Instead, MAGA influencers are trying to use this incident to mobilize Trump supporters to become increasingly engaged with the campaign in the long term, particularly as the 2024 campaign starts to pick up over the coming months.”  \n  \n\n      The Trump campaign claims to have raised more than $4 million in the 24 hours after the indictment was reported last Thursday. \n  \n\n      Meghan Conroy, a former investigator on the House January 6 select committee, told CNN that she expected that far-right online denizens would behave similarly to how they did after the FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence last year, with more bluster than bite in terms of threats. \n  \n\n      Still, one of Trump’s supporters responded to the Mar-a-Lago search by attempting to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office with an assault rifle. \n  \n\n      “Am I worried about mass, January 6th-style mobilization in support of Trump? No,” said Conroy, who is now a research fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “Am I worried about targeted attacks against the Manhattan DA, members of the Democratic Party, so-called RINOs, or any number of the individuals or entities that Trump has tried to sic his followers on? Absolutely.” \n  \n\n      Katherine Keneally, a senior research manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which tracks online threats, said one reason the calls for violence have been limited after news of Trump’s indictment broke is because his supporters fear being arrested like many of the January 6 rioters were.  \n  \n\n      “Leading up to Tuesday, we will be looking for any new narratives surrounding the indictment that mobilize individuals to offline action, indicators that supporters are organizing (particularly any extremist groups), and content suggestive of credible threats,” Keneally told CNN. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Defendant has a long history of discussing his legal matters publicly—including by targeting witnesses, jurors, investigators, prosecutors, and judges with harassing, embarrassing, and threatening statements on social media and in other public forums—and he has already done so in this case,” prosecutors wrote in the filing.\n  \n\n      Manhattan prosecutors have accused Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. The criminal charges stem from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush money payments, made during the 2016 campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.\n  \n\n      In seeking the protective order, prosecutors cited some of Trump’s past attacks on witnesses who previously spoke out against him, including his former personal attorney Michael Cohen and Alexander Vindman, a former national security official who testified publicly during Trump’s first impeachment.\n  \n\n      They asked the judge to order that Trump only be allowed to view certain material turned over by prosecutors in the presence of his defense counsel and not allow him to copy material designated as “limited dissemination materials.”\n  \n\n      Specifically, they asked the judge to instruct anyone who receives materials, including grand jury testimony, to not post them on any news organization or social media websites without approval from the judge. They also asked the judge to limit the use of any materials they provide to Trump to defending the present case.\n  \n\n      “At the outset, it is important to note that the People are not at this time seeking a gag order in this case. Defendant has a constitutional right to speak publicly about this case, and the People do not seek to infringe upon that right,” prosecutors wrote. \n  \n\n      Prosecutors also asked the judge to limit the review of images of two cell phones related to a witness in the case to Trump’s defense lawyers, saying there is highly personal information included on the phones. \n  \n\n      In addition to limiting the disclosure of certain information prosecutors turn over to Trump from becoming public, they also asked the judge to limit the disclosure of identifying information about any support staff working for the prosecution team to the public until jury selection begins in the case. \n  \n\n      They cited Trump’s past statements about Bragg and the judge in the case. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nEditor’s Note: David Orentlicher is the Judge Jack and Lulu Lehman Professor at the William S. Boyd School of Law at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he specializes in constitutional law and health law. He also serves as a Democrat in the Nevada Assembly. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n      For good reason, we say that no person is above the law. So it is essential that prosecutors hold former President Donald Trump accountable for any potential misconduct. And there is plenty to try to hold Trump accountable for: his role in the violent attack on the US Capitol and on our democracy on January 6, 2021, his other apparent efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Appropriately, federal and state officials are investigating or already suing for these many misdeeds.\n  \n\n      But in his decision to prosecute Trump because of his alleged role in falsifying business records related to hush money payments to women who alleged extramarital affairs with him during the 2016 campaign, New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg has taken the wrong path to accountability for the former president. \n  \n\n      Trump’s relationship with adult film star Stormy Daniels and his alleged payments to her, via his former lawyer Michael Cohen, raise substantial ethical concerns — but they are not matters that should be addressed in a courtroom.\n  \n\n      Bragg is charging that Cohen’s payoffs to Daniels, allegedly on Trump’s behalf, violated election laws. While the indictment doesn’t specify which laws, the most likely candidate is Trump’s failure to report the payments as a campaign expenditure. In this view, because the payments were made to influence the 2016 presidential election by shielding Trump from negative attention, they constituted campaign expenditures. Trump denies the charges.\n  \n\n      But this is a dubious legal theory. Since candidates are not allowed to use their campaign funds for personal expenses, and Trump’s relationship with Daniels was a personal matter, it actually makes sense that Trump didn’t report the payments on campaign filings. \n  \n\n      Indeed, there are a host of personal expenditures a candidate makes over the course of their campaign that could conceivably benefit their candidacy, but it would be wrong to require their disclosure and, moreover, allow their reimbursement. \n  \n\nOpinion: Alvin Bragg was right to prosecute Donald Trump\n\n\n      Indeed, this legal theory has never been used successfully against a candidate, including an attempt made to prosecute former Sen. John Edwards. His campaign donors had made payments during his 2008 presidential campaign “to facilitate Edwards’ extra-marital affair, and to conceal it and the resulting pregnancy from the public,” in the words of the indictment against him. He was later acquitted. \n  \n\n      To be sure, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for his role in the payments to Daniels, but he did so while also pleading guilty to charges he faced because of his own tax evasion and financial fraud. Even if Cohen believed the campaign finance charges meritless, he may have accepted them to reduce his exposure to the other charges filed against him.\n  \n\n      Moreover, consider the implications of treating hush money payments — which are not illegal — as campaign expenditures that have to be reported in campaign finance filings. If a disgruntled lover threatens to disclose past intimacies, a candidate would open the door to the former lover going public by not making hush money payments. But if the candidate pays the hush money, the payments would then need to be included in the candidate’s financial reports, which are public records. \n  \n\nOpinion: The images of Trump's historic day tell a surprising story\n\n\n      Either way, candidates would have to sacrifice the privacy of their consensual sexual relationships once they throw their hats in the ring. The public has a legitimate interest in the health and finances of candidates, but not their sex lives. We should not be policing the bedrooms of candidates, especially when some consensual relationships are unfairly stigmatized.\n  \n\n      But it is not only wrong for Bragg to file questionable charges, it’s also unnecessary — charges can be brought for Trump’s serious misconduct on other matters. Unfortunately, bringing misguided charges is a recurring theme with Trump and has compromised the effort to hold him accountable. \n  \n\n      Consider his second impeachment. While the US House of Representatives acted correctly in bringing charges against Trump for his role in the attack on the Capitol on January 6, House Democrats filed charges that were legally problematic instead of charges that were solidly grounded.  \n  \n\n      When the House accused Trump of incitement in the January 6 violence, it wasn’t clear that his actions satisfied the very strict legal standard for proving incitement. For example, Trump sent mixed messages when he spoke to the assembled crowd before it marched on the Capitol, telling them both to fight like hell and peacefully make their voices heard. \n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      In contrast, the evidence clearly showed that Trump failed miserably in his duty as president to “protect and defend the Constitution” by not stemming the violence once rioters breached the Capitol. The second impeachment should have been based on this obvious dereliction of duty.\n  \n\n      Bragg and other prosecutors ought to hold Trump accountable for his misconduct, and both criminal and civil charges may be necessary to do so. But it also is essential that charges be brought for misdeeds that are truly unlawful. Once law enforcement officials stretch the law in pursuit of one defendant, they will inevitably do so for other persons, and that will ultimately undermine the rule of law.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Former President Donald Trump’s legal team has lost a bid for emergency help from the federal appeals court in Washington, DC, to block some of his closest advisers from testifying about him to a grand jury, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to a new court filing. \n  \n\n      Trump’s team on Monday night asked for the appeals court to wipe away a lower court’s ruling that would force several of his top advisers to answer questions to a grand jury investigating Trump and his allies’ attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, despite his claims of legal protections around his presidency that would shield some of their testimony.\n  \n\n      The appeals court denied his request on Tuesday, dealing Trump another legal setback just before he is set to enter a courtroom in Manhattan to face criminal charges in a separate investigation.\n  \n\n      The swift decision means advisers to Trump, including Meadows, could be brought into the federal grand jury in Washington by prosecutors in the coming days. Trump would need a court to intervene in his favor in order to block their subpoenas.\n  \n\n      By early Tuesday afternoon, prosecutors from the special counsel’s office who are focused on January 6-related cases already had brought former Homeland Security acting secretary Ken Cuccinelli back to the grand jury. Cuccinelli previously testified to the grand jury in Washington in January.\n  \n\n      Overnight, a panel of three judges on the appeals court – Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Greg Katsas – had sought a response from the Justice Department regarding Trump’s request. The Justice Department responded about two hours later. \n  \n\n      An appeal on the larger legal questions around executive privilege assertions could still live on before the appeals court, but the activity around Trump’s emergency request for a stay would determine now if witnesses must comply with Justice Department subpoenas and the lower court’s decision against Trump.\n  \n\n      Trump’s team is unlikely to ask the Supreme Court for help, one source told CNN. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.\n  \n\n      The case is sealed and Trump and the Justice Department are not named in the filings. The Biden administration has repeatedly declined to assert executive privilege for the presidency related to Trump’s actions around January 6, 2021, when issues like these came up in previous situations.\n  \n\n      Other witnesses who may be affected by the ruling include Trump’s former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, former national security adviser Robert O’Brien and several Trump White House advisers such as Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino. CNN has confirmed some of the witnesses previously testified to the grand jury, but may have declined to answer some questions at Trump’s direction.\n  \n\n      Special counsel Jack Smith’s team is seeking grand jury testimony from these senior Trump aides as part of the wide-ranging criminal probe into Trump’s post-election actions in 2020 and the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n  \n\n      Last week, Trump went to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge the underlying ruling in the case, from DC District Court Judge Beryl Howell in March. But on Monday, two of Trump’s defense lawyers, Evan Corcoran and James Trusty, visited another district court judge who now oversees grand jury proceedings, Chief Judge James Boasberg, to ask for a pause on the case, the source said. He denied their request, prompting the Trump team to go to the appeals court seeking emergency help, according to the source.\n  \n\n      The ruling from Howell ordering Meadows and others to answer questions was one of the last in her tenure as chief judge of the DC District Court, and added to a pile of losses for Trump as he has tried unsuccessfully to block federal prosecutors from obtaining testimony in the January 6, 2021, and Mar-a-Lago criminal investigations. Separately, Boasberg recently decided former Vice President Mike Pence would need to testify in the same investigation.\n  \n\n      Trump has lost repeatedly in court on executive privilege claims, with the Justice Department able to overcome presidential secrecy because of the grand jury investigation needs. While Trump’s team has criticized the prosecutorial steps as overreach, the court’s decisions are in line with what criminal investigations have been able to achieve dating back to the Watergate investigation.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n\n  CNN’s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nPresident Joe Biden launched a reelection bid like none before it on Tuesday with a call for Americans to choose him again to save democracy – less than three years after his defeat of Donald Trump was supposed to restore normality and unite the country.\n  \n\n      Biden’s quest for a second term will unfold amid what would normally be deeply unpromising circumstances, with his approval rating languishing in the low 40s, with the country exhausted by successive crises after pandemic isolation ceded to a battle with soaring inflation. Polls show that a majority of voters – and even a majority of Democrats – don’t want him to run again. And the last thing the country appears to want is a Biden rematch with the 45th president, who’s the current frontrunner in the nascent Republican primary race. \n  \n\n      But Trump’s strength inside the GOP forms the core rationale for Biden’s campaign. The incumbent reasons that he’s the best bet Democrats have to prevent his predecessor from winning a second term that would surely be even more wild than the first.\n  \n\nElection 2024: A consequential rematch of serial candidates\n\n\n      Biden is beginning his final campaign after a lifetime in politics from a familiar position of low expectations. But he’s repeatedly defied conventional political wisdom and connected with swing voters by standing as the antidote to Republican extremism. Paradoxically, even though much of his party seems to wish it had an alternative, Biden appears sufficiently strong to ward off the emergence of any significant primary challengers. \n  \n\n      The president ignited his reelection bid with the release of a campaign video on Tuesday – four years to the day after launching what was then seen as a long-shot effort to fulfill a White House dream first kindled by an unsuccessful race for the 1988 Democratic nomination.\n  \n\n      “When I ran for president four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are,” he said in the video, which opened with images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection and abortion rights activists protesting at the US Supreme Court.\n  \n\n      Biden’s video made clear that he will run less on his record in office than against Republican “MAGA extremism” which he cast as a grave threat to democracy and abortion rights. The video showed Trump and his possibly most threatening rival in the GOP primary race, Florida Gov Ron DeSantis, together, portraying them as twin leaders in Republican radicalism. It also spotlighted far-right Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Biden vowed to continue to fight to secure American democratic and personal freedoms and Social Security retirement benefits.\n  \n\n      “That’s been the work of my first term – to fight for our democracy,” Biden said, warning that now was not a time to be complacent.\n  \n\n      The Republican National Committee issued its own video in response, portraying a futuristic vision of a world and a nation in chaos in a Biden second term, beset by war, a border crisis, rampant crime and a financial collapse at home. The video ended with the words “Who’s in charge here? It feels like the train is coming off the tracks.”\n  \n\n      Amazingly, the same motivation that underwrote Biden’s 2020 White House run – Trump’s threat to US democratic institutions and values – will be the foundation of his reelection bid. Biden, in the shadow boxing of an unannounced 2024 bid, has fulminated against “MAGA extremism” and anchored a surprising Democratic showing in the 2022 midterms on the same theme.\n  \n\n      It will be months before the first votes are cast in the Republican primary. And it’s more than 18 months before Americans pick their next president. Events yet to occur in the US and abroad could transform the race. Unexpected turns in the lives and careers of both Biden and Trump – and the handful of other candidates vying for the GOP nomination – could change everything. And recent elections have shown that punditry and polling don’t always capture surprising results.\n  \n\nBiden announces reelection bid, saying battle for nation’s soul isn’t completeFollow live updatesAnalysis: Biden joins Trump in the 2024 race, with each making a historic bid for reelectionElection 2024: A consequential rematch of serial candidates\n\nBiden announces reelection bid, saying battle for nation’s soul isn’t completeFollow live updatesAnalysis: Biden joins Trump in the 2024 race, with each making a historic bid for reelectionElection 2024: A consequential rematch of serial candidates\n\n      Yet circumstances are conjuring a unique presidential race that reflects the country’s polarized, unsettled state and will likely again challenge political institutions and American unity.\n  \n\n      This is a nation that often leverages elections to empower a new generation. But it’s now contemplating the possibility of a race between an incumbent who would be 86 by the end of his second term and a challenger who would be 82 at the same point. The oldest combined matchup in US presidential history would probably be welcome for Biden since the optics of a match-up against a younger challenger – for instance, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is yet to launch a primary bid – could alter the feel of the race.\n  \n\nWhy 2024 could be the most boring presidential primary season ever\n\n\n      In an even more remarkable twist, Trump is seeking to pull off a feat accomplished only once before in US history – by Grover Cleveland, who served non consecutive terms after he won a return to office in 1892.\n  \n\n      Trump’s political longevity is another anomaly in 2024.\n  \n\n      Presidents defeated after only a single term usually fade into retirement and don’t return to challenge their vanquisher. But Trump is still the most dominant figure in a Republican Party he ripped from its corporate foundations and turned into a populist vessel for conservative culture wars. Even more incredibly, Trump is attempting a return after leaving office in disgrace after being twice impeached for abusing power. He then refused to accept the will of voters in 2020 and incited an insurrection in a bid to cling to power.\n  \n\n      Two weeks after Trump’s mob stormed Congress, Biden told Americans in his inaugural address, “We have learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile, at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.”\n  \n\n      But the fact that Biden is entering his reelection campaign again warning that democracy is under threat reflects the reality of a nation caught in an existential struggle over its institutions and still reeling under the influence of the most turbulent presidency – and ex-presidency – in history.\n  \n\n      If anything, Trump’s threat to democracy has only increased – a factor that will play into Biden’s campaign. He is promising to flush out the professional civil service in Washington and to gut the Justice Department, which he claims is subjecting him to a political persecution.\n  \n\n      In his first campaign rally in Waco, Texas, last month, Trump warned, “Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.”\n  \n\n      Vowing to purge “thugs and criminals” in the judicial system, he added, chillingly: “I am your warrior. I am your justice.”\n  \n\n      Trump’s anti-democratic rhetoric points to another extraordinary dimension of the 2024 race that Biden is expected to officially join on Tuesday.\n  \n\n      The former president’s claims of political persecution are rooted in the multiple legal threats that make his candidacy like none before it. Trump is facing the real threat of criminal charges over his attempts to steal the 2020 election and, separately, over his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n  \n\n      On Monday, Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, said she would announce this summer whether she would charge Trump and associates over their bid to overturn his loss in the Peach State in 2020. Already, Trump has been criminally charged in Manhattan in relation to a hush money payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty in New York and maintains he hasn’t done anything wrong in any of the cases against him. \n  \n\n      While Trump appears to have seen a short-term political boost from the Manhattan indictment, there is no precedent for a presidential candidate facing multiple and simultaneous criminal investigations, and it is possible that such a scenario could play into the hands of a candidate like DeSantis, who is promising to implement a Trump-style agenda without the unhinged distractions that typically swirl around the ex-president.\n  \n\n      At this point, however, no potential GOP rival has managed or dared to weaponize Trump’s legal woes for political gain – a factor that adds to the belief of many Democrats that he’ll win the GOP nomination.\n  \n\n      Biden defined his 2020 campaign, his presidency and the build-up to his reelection bid by who he is not – Trump. He often quips when talking about his political campaigns, “Don’t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.” But this will not be sufficient as he seeks a second term. Biden will have to defend his presidency and convince voters that they are better off than when he took over amid the political fire and fury of Trump’s exit.\n  \n\n      He will never escape questions over his age. Any signs of unsteadiness or tiredness will prompt Republicans to argue he should be retired. Serving as president while running for president has defeated younger men. And this race figures to be more grueling than the last one he ran, when the Covid-19 pandemic all but suspended normal campaigning.\n  \n\n      But Biden’s faith in the power of comparisons could help him. Trump, after all, would turn 80 during a second term. And the president will argue Americans can’t afford the chaos that reigned the last time Trump was in the White House. He can point to a huge bipartisan infrastructure bill that the White House says is triggering an industrial rebirth in the Midwest. Unemployment has been consistently near record lows while Biden has been in office, although the highest inflation in 40 years – which has now significantly moderated but which the president downplayed – convinced many Americans that they were locked in a prolonged economic crisis. High gas prices last year had a similar effect. And any downturn next year could be disastrous for the president’s hopes and play into Trump’s selective claims that the country experienced a golden age when he was in charge.\n  \n\n      As Biden claims to have defended democracy at home, he is also sure to compare his revival of the Western alliance in defense of Ukraine to Trump’s continuing hero worship of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n  \n\n      Democrats will also seek to exploit the overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion by a conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump and the continuing conservative drive to eradicate the procedure entirely. Concern among some moderate Republicans suggests that Biden may find a rich political seam on the issue, which has already galvanized voters in elections since Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer.\n  \n\n      Ultimately, the president knows his fate will come down to the same swing states that put him in office with narrow margins – including Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania. Democrats will put their faith in the evidence of the last three national elections, which showed the ex-president was disastrous for GOP hopes in many of the most competitive states.\n  \n\n      So while Biden will have to run on his record like any other incumbent, he’s sure to anchor his campaign around Trump.\n  \n\n      In a speech in Maryland this month, Biden mentioned MAGA – his pejorative code word for Trump Republicans – more than 20 times.\n  \n\n      It was a clear sign. Even if Trump isn’t the Republican nominee, Biden still plans to run against him.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

                "content": "\n      An ex-president who’s always on the attack will no longer be the sole orchestrator of his fate.\n  \n\n      When Donald Trump officially becomes a criminal defendant on Tuesday, he’ll be subject to a legal system he can’t control.\n  \n\n      Trump has long conjured political storms, alternative realities, legal imbroglios and media spectacles to blur the truth or discredit institutions that have constrained his rule-busting behavior. He’ll lose that ability when he steps before the court at his arraignment in a case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress.\n  \n\n      And there are increasing signs that this new reality – which will come with hefty financial commitments in legal fees and locks on Trump’s calendar – could be multiplied at a time when he’s already facing the intense demands of another White House bid.\n  \n\n      That’s because the ex-president – the first to face criminal charges – also appears to face serious problems in a potentially more perilous case involving his alleged mishandling of secret documents being investigated by special counsel Jack Smith. Charges look like an increasing possibility as the Justice Department secures evidence about Trump’s handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. \n  \n\nSpecial counsel nailing down evidence of how Trump handled classified records at Mar-a-Lago\n\n\n      Smith’s prosecutors have secured daily notes, texts, emails and photographs and are focused on cataloguing how Trump handled classified records around Mar-a-Lago and those who may have witnessed the former president with them, CNN’s Katelyn Polantz and Evan Perez reported Monday. The new details coincide with signs the Justice Department is taking steps consistent with the end of an investigation.\n  \n\n      Trump’s former lawyer, Ty Cobb, told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the developments represent a serious turn in the case for the ex-president. “We’ve known the investigatory steps were under way, we just haven’t known alleged results until today,” Cobb said. “I think these are highly consequential.”\n  \n\n      The documents case may not be the end of it. Smith is also investigating Trump’s conduct in the run-up to the US Capitol insurrection. Then there’s also a possible prosecution in Georgia led by a district attorney probing the ex-president’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election result in the swing state.\n  \n\n      Trump denies any wrongdoing in all of these investigations. He has described his behavior in Georgia as “perfect.” And he has lambasted the sealed indictment in New York, where he faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud, as an example of politicized justice.\n  \n\n      But at a grave moment for the country, given that an ex-president and current presidential candidate is about to appear in court, there’s also growing sense of inexorably building pressure on Trump that will compromise his capacity to evade accountability.\n  \n\n      Trump made a big show on Monday of his return to New York ahead of his arraignment. The snaking motorcade of black Secret Service SUVs to and from his private Boeing 757 in its sparkling new livery carried overtones of a presidential movement in a power play meant to send a message of strength.\n  \n\n      Trump is itching to speak publicly. After court Tuesday, he will return to his Mar-a-Lago resort and reclaim the media spotlight with a primetime speech he will likely use to proclaim his innocence, attack the New York case as political persecution and try to distract from the fact he will be a criminal defendant.\n  \n\n      Multiple people familiar with Trump’s thinking tell CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Kristen Holmes, however, that he has weighed speaking even earlier, in Manhattan, even as advisers caution the former president that any unplanned remarks put him at high risk of hurting his case. His speech Tuesday night is expected to have legal eyes on it before he delivers it.\n  \n\nWhat to know about the Trump indictment on the eve of his court appearance\n\n\n      But despite his bravura and talk by pundits that he will alchemize his legal problems into political gold, Monday was a dark day for Trump. He was returning to his old stomping ground in Manhattan under duress, to turn himself in on Tuesday over the first-ever criminal charges ever laid against an ex-president. Trump has long been a force of nature who rebels against constraints and has always been impossible for his staff to control. But now he will be subject to the dictates of a judge and the rules and conventions of the legal system, which will be far harder for him to disrupt and divert than the institutions of political accountability he has subverted. \n  \n\n      At times, he may be compelled to appear in court. The grueling pre-trial process, with its numerous legal argument deadlines and heaps of evidence the defense must sift through, will impose severe demands on a legal team that has often struggled to act coherently. Ahead of his appearance Tuesday, for instance, Trump made a late shuffle of his legal team, bringing in another attorney, Todd Blanche, to serve as his lead counsel – a move some saw as sidelining another attorney, Joe Tacopina. The ex-president’s camp pushed back on this interpretation, however.\n  \n\n      One criminal prosecution is onerous enough. Trump hasn’t been charged in any of the other cases, but a multi-front defense in multiple cases would represent an extraordinary storm. And it would further disrupt the ex-president’s capacity to dictate his political schedule and control his destiny. When he was under scrutiny in the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, or during his two impeachments, Trump exploited his huge popularity with Republican voters to discredit accusations against him. He pressured most GOP senators, who knew they would pay with their careers if they voted to convict him in an impeachment trial. \n  \n\n      While public opinion will be critical in shaping the political impact of the New York case, the prosecution itself will be insulated. Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan, who will preside over Trump’s arraignment, is immune to his political pressure. In fact, Trump’s attacks on prosecutors or the judge could backfire in a legal arena. And even a former president can’t disregard the choreography of a court case and rules of criminal procedure. \n  \n\n      The situation is somewhat similar to the 2020 election, when the will of voters prevailed because Trump’s attempts to have votes thrown out and results changed foundered in multiple courts because of the fact-based standards of evidence and the law.\n  \n\nJudge won't let news cameras broadcast Trump's full court appearance\n\n\n      Trump’s lawyers attempted to wrest some control of the court proceedings on Monday, arguing against a request by news organizations, including CNN, to allow television cameras into Tuesday’s arraignment. The media outlets argued that the case was of such public interest that it should be broadcast. But Trump’s lawyers told the judge that “it will create a circus-like atmosphere at the arraignment, raise unique security concerns, and is inconsistent with President Trump’s presumption of innocence.” \n  \n\n      In a late-night ruling, Merchan turned down the request for broadcast cameras. Five still photographers will be allowed to take pictures of Trump and the courtroom before the hearing begins, however.\n  \n\n      But the irony of the ex-president complaining about being the subject of a media circus was rich indeed. Without his salesman’s talent for whipping up media circuses, he’d have never have been president. Trump built his “The Art of the Deal” mythology in New York by constantly providing fodder for the city’s ravenous tabloids with his famed celebrity feuds, colorful personal life and business hits and failures. His entire 2016 campaign and his single-term presidency were pageants of outrage, scandal and lawlessness stoked by his often unchained Twitter posts.\n  \n\n      If anyone knows how to thrive in a media circus, it is Trump. The difference, perhaps, in this case is that he fears being part of a media circus that he can no longer control.\n  \n\n  Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      For people who write about electoral, or “horse race,” politics, few things are more enjoyable than an exciting presidential primary season. \n  \n\n      Sometimes, both Democrats and Republicans cooperate by holding gripping fights for the party nods (see 2008). Sometimes, however, voters in both parties quickly coalesce around front-runners (see 2000). \n  \n\n      A look at the current dynamics in both parties suggests 2024 could be one of the most, if not the most, boring primary cycles in the last 50 years. \n  \n\n      Nothing is set in stone. Things can change when you least expect it, but it’s tough not to acknowledge the current facts. \n  \n\n      Let’s start on the Democratic side, where President Joe Biden is expected to announce as early as Tuesday that he is running for reelection. No incumbent president has lost a state primary (where he was on the ballot) since 1980. \n  \n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. can't count on family support to take on Biden\n\n\n      At this point, Biden doesn’t look likely to break that streak. He hasn’t attracted a challenger who would be considered serious under most metrics. Neither Marianne Williamson nor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ever held elected office. Williamson gained no traction during her 2020 presidential bid. Kennedy pushes debunked conspiracy theories about vaccine safety and is seeking votes from an electorate that is overwhelmingly vaccinated against Covid-19. \n  \n\n      The very limited polling so far shows Biden with a large advantage over Williamson and Kennedy.\n  \n\n      Perhaps more importantly, few Democratic elected officials have indicated anything other than loyalty to a 2024 Biden bid. That’s key for a few reasons. \n  \n\n      First, primary endorsements are as good a predictor at this point of primary success as polling is. \n  \n\n      Second, it’s true that Democratic primary voters tell pollsters they are open to listening to a credible challenger to Biden. The president, after all, would be 82 years old at the start of a potential second term. \n  \n\n      But as Billy Preston once sang, “Nothin’ from nothin’ leaves nothin’.” That polling hypothetical means nothing if no one with a base within the party runs. \n  \n\n      Biden’s strong approval rating among Democrats is well in line with that of previous incumbents who cruised to renomination. So it’s not like Democratic voters will be kicking and screaming if they have to support Biden for another term. \n  \n\n      On the Republican side, former President Donald Trump finds himself in his best position in a very long time to win the GOP nomination. \n  \n\n      I’m unaware of a single recent reliable national or early-voting-state-level poll that shows Trump with anything other than a “big league” edge over both declared and potential 2024 opponents. He’s regularly at around 50% in national surveys. \n  \n\nWhy Trump is still favored for the GOP nomination, despite his indictment\n\n\n      This 50% is key because it’s so rare for someone to be polling at that level at this early juncture and not win the nomination. Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000, Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 were the sole candidates running in incumbent-free primaries who were near, at or above 50% in early national polling. \n  \n\n      All four of them were able to secure the nominations with relative ease, and Clinton was the only one who lost more than a handful of primary contests.  \n  \n\n      For an example of someone polling like Trump is now and then losing the party nomination, you have to look at primaries involving an incumbent. Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 Democratic primary to President Jimmy Carter, despite easily leading him in polling at this point in the cycle. \n  \n\n      It’s possible that since Trump is the first former president to actively seek a presidential nomination in over 80 years, the early national polling means less than it normally does. \n  \n\n      That said, Trump has more going for him than national polling. For one thing, his early-state-level polling looks as good as it has in a while. A University of New Hampshire poll released last week puts him up 20 points on Ron DeSantis in a hypothetical Granite State GOP primary, after he trailed the Florida governor by 12 points in January. \n  \n\n      This polling is supported by something that eluded Trump when he first ran for the presidency in 2015: endorsements from elected officials. Trump didn’t get his first one from a governor or member of Congress until after winning his first primary contest during the 2016 cycle. \n  \n\n      This time around, Trump already has over 60 endorsements from governors and members of Congress. Since 1980, candidates with comparable collections of gubernatorial and congressional endorsements at this point in the cycle have all gone on to win their parties’ nominations.\n  \n\nDeSantis allies prepare for financial show of force as Florida governor seeks to overcome early stumbles\n\n\n      Most impressive is what Trump has done in Florida. DeSantis would be Trump’s most serious challenger by far if he decides to run. He’s the only one breaking into double digits in the average national and early-state polling. \n  \n\n      Yet Trump has gone into Florida and already secured endorsements from a majority of Republicans in the state’s US House delegation. Some of those endorsements aren’t surprising (e.g., Rep. Matt Gaetz). Some of them are notable, such as Rep. Byron Donalds, who introduced DeSantis at his 2022 reelection victory party. \n  \n\n      Trump, like Biden, seems to have two things going for him: a large share of Republican voters and the party behind him. If those two were in opposition to each other, the primary season would have looked far more interesting. \n  \n\n      So unless something changes, we’re looking at a recipe for primary success for both the current president and the man he succeeded. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      A slew of 2024 GOP presidential hopefuls courted gun rights activists Friday at a National Rifle Association convention in Indianapolis that took place in the wake of mass shootings in Kentucky and Tennessee in recent days.\n  \n\n      Former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence – the former ticket-mates who have split over Trump’s actions leading up to and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol – attended the gathering, and lambasted President Joe Biden.\n  \n\n      Trump insisted that the United States does not have a “gun problem” that has led to a rash of mass shootings – but rather what he described as a mental health, social, cultural and spiritual problem. He  accused Democrats of a “left-wing crusade to weaponize government against law-abiding citizens.” \n  \n\n      “The politically incorrect truth that no one on the left wants to admit is that violent crime is rarely committed by legal gun-owners, it is committed by a brutal class of hardened repeat criminals,” Trump said. \n  \n\n      He also offered a series of proposals intended to win over gun rights activists, including proposing that Congress enact national concealed carry reciprocity, which would mean concealed carry permits apply across state lines “just like your driver’s license and marriage license.” \n  \n\n      He proposed a tax credit to reimburse teachers for the cost of firearms and training. He said he would appoint “ferocious crimefighters” as federal prosecutors. And he said he would direct the Food and Drug Administration to investigate whether “transgender hormone treatments and ideology” and “common psychiatric drugs” are contributing to gun violence. \n  \n\n      “I think most of us already know the answer, don’t we?” he said.\n  \n\n      Trump was scheduled to take the stage about two hours after his former vice president had appeared, and received some boos from the crowd. \n  \n\n      Trump nudged the crowd to be nicer to his former vice president despite their rift over Trump’s actions leading up to and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n  \n\n      “I hope you gave Pence a good, warm approval,” Trump said. \n  \n\n      When some members of the crowd booed the former president’s mention of Pence, Trump interjected. \n  \n\n      “No, because he is a nice man, if you want to really know the truth,” Trump said. “He is. He’s a good man, and I heard it was very rough.”\n  \n\n      Pence did not take on Trump – and only used the former president’s name when touting the accomplishments of “the Trump-Pence administration,” including appointing three conservatives to the Supreme Court. \n  \n\n      Instead, he criticized Biden and Democrats, claiming that the left has responded to the mass shootings in Tennessee and Kentucky with “pipe dreams of gun confiscation.” \n  \n\n      “Stop endangering our lives with gun bans, and stop trampling on the God-given rights of the American people every time tragedy happens,” Pence said. \n  \n\n      He argued for Congress to fund armed officers for every public and private school, as well as increased institutionalization of those with mental health challenges and the quick execution of mass shooters. \n  \n\n      “The most prosperous nation in the history of the world can afford to protect our kids. It’ll just take leadership to do it,” Pence said. “So stand with law enforcement. Protect our kids.” \n  \n\n      Other potential Republican 2024 contenders also sought to court the thousands of activists in Indianapolis for the four-day convention. \n  \n\n      South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order on stage blocking state agencies from doing business with banks that have implemented policies against doing business with the gun industry. \n  \n\n      In a video message, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also bragged about taking on “woke financial institutions” and allowing Floridians to concealed carry without government-issued permits. \n  \n\n      Former United Nations ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley touted expanding her state’s “stand your ground” law.\n  \n\n      “Know that you’ve always got a friend in me; you’ve got a partner in me as they try and take away any of our constitutional rights,” said Haley, who has officially entered the 2024 race. \n  \n\n      New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu briefly criticized Trump, pointing to the former president voicing support after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, for confiscating guns from certain individuals. “Take the firearms first, and then go to court,” Trump said at the time. \n  \n\n      “What is that about?” Sununu said after recounting Trump’s comments without using his name. \n  \n\n      Those 2024 contenders spoke at a Friday afternoon “leadership forum” during the convention, which began Thursday and ends Sunday. \n  \n\n      The NRA, the nation’s foremost gun lobby, has seen its power wane in recent years amid leadership fights and legal battles. In 2021, the organization attempted to declare bankruptcy – an effort rejected by a federal judge. Still, the group is influential among conservatives, and its annual gatherings remain a magnet for presidential hopefuls. \n  \n\n      This year’s gathering in Indianapolis is taking place four days after a gunman killed five people at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, and less than three weeks after another shooter killed three children and three adults at an elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee. \n  \n\n      It’s reminiscent of last year’s NRA convention going on as scheduled in Houston, just days after 19 children and two adults were killed by a gunman at an elementary school 280 miles west in Uvalde, Texas. At that convention, Trump seemingly jabbed at speakers who had canceled after the deadly shooting. \n  \n\n      The NRA’s annual conventions underscore how deeply entrenched gun rights advocates and Republican political figures have become despite the United States’ rash of mass shootings in recent years. In 1999, after the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colorado, NRA officials huddled on a conference call and discussed canceling their convention, according to tapes of those meetings published by NPR in 2021. \n  \n\n      “The Republican Party continues to put the gun industry and the gun makers before the safety of our kids and our families. It’s extraordinary, it’s heartbreaking and it’s infuriating,” Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told reporters on a call Thursday. \n  \n\n      There have been occasional signs of cracks in the GOP’s opposition to new gun control measures. \n  \n\n      Last year, after 15 Senate Republicans joined Democrats to advance the measure, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that offers grants to states that enact “red flag” laws and crisis prevention programs, and closed the so-called “boyfriend loophole” to prevent gun purchases by unmarried partners convicted of violence. The passage came just over a month after the Uvalde shooting. \n  \n\n      And in Tennessee – following gun control protests in the state capitol and the expulsion of two Democratic members from the legislative body for their participation in those demonstrations – Republican Gov. Bill Lee this week signed an executive order intended to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, and has urged the Republican-led legislature to approve a “red flag” law. \n  \n\n      “It is possible to get this done. We should work to set aside our differences and accomplish something that Tennesseans want us to get accomplished,” Lee said Tuesday.\n  \n\n      Still, in the early stages of the 2024 presidential race, Republican contenders are squarely focused on appealing to the party’s pro-gun rights base. \n  \n\n      The NRA endorsed Trump in May 2016 – a surprise at the time, since the organization historically has waited for the GOP to choose its presidential nominee. But an early endorsement appears unlikely at this stage as the GOP’s 2024 field takes shape, despite efforts from Trump’s team to try to secure the support. \n  \n\n      Gun rights advocates have described Trump’s presidency as a mixed bag, noting that he did not follow through on promises to ban gun-free zones, did not push for national concealed carry and banned bump stocks. The legacy of his presidency on gun rights could evolve over years and decades as his three Supreme Court selections issue new rulings.\n  \n\n      “I will say that during the Trump administration, we lost some Second Amendment rights and we gained some rights,” said Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America.\n  \n\n      Johnston said the organization’s top issues for the 2024 GOP primary are seeking a commitment to abolish the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives database of firearm transactions, as well as national concealed carry reciprocity and a promise not to seek new firearms restrictions through ATF policies without congressional approval.\n  \n\n      Trump’s advisers pushed back on the notion that the former president was anything but a powerful protector of the Second Amendment.\n  \n\n      Allies of DeSantis signaled they see an opening for the Florida governor to take on Trump over gun rights in the 2024 race.\n  \n\n      “Governor DeSantis is a proven champion of our Constitutional right to bear arms and took action as governor to strengthen and affirm the Second Amendment, including signing constitutional carry legislation into law this month,” said Erin Perrine, spokeswoman for Never Back Down, a super PAC that is encouraging DeSantis to run for president.\n  \n\n      “Donald Trump made promises to NRA members when he ran for office, but then as president, he caved to pressure from the Washington establishment, liberal media, and gun-grabbing Democrats and attacked the NRA, siding with liberal Democrat Senators like Chris Murphy and Dianne Feinstein in support of their gun control legislation,” Perrine said.\n  \n\n      Earlier this month, the NRA heaped praise on DeSantis after the governor signed a bill that would allow Florida residents to carry a concealed weapon in public without a permit. Representatives from the group were on hand for a private signing ceremony. The NRA on its policy website called it a “Historic NRA Win.”\n  \n\n      But for some gun-rights activists, the bill didn’t go far enough. The Florida chapter of Gun Owners of America pushed GOP lawmakers to let anyone carry a gun openly in public and criticized the bill DeSantis signed as a half-measure.\n  \n\n      In a recording posted on Twitter, a representative for the organization cornered DeSantis at an event to get him on the record. While DeSantis told the activist he supported open carry, he correctly predicted GOP legislative leaders wouldn’t support it.\n  \n\n      “He’s on the right side of the issue,” Johnston said, “and blame squarely rests with the state legislature.”\n  \n\n      DeSantis, though, has pushed many of his priorities through the GOP-controlled legislature, often forcing Republican lawmakers to take uncomfortable votes on divisive bills. On firearm legislation, however, DeSantis has suggested his political capital only extends so far.\n  \n\n      “If they send me something that is 90% or 80%, I mean, I’m going to take that win and we come back for more at some time in the future,” DeSantis said at an event in Georgia.\n  \n\n      As a candidate for governor in 2018, DeSantis opposed steps taken after the Parkland high school massacre to curb gun violence by creating the state’s red flag law and raising the age to own a firearm to 21. Both those measures remain the law today. DeSantis during that race also backed allowing guns on college campuses, but five years into his tenure, the state’s public universities are gun-free zones.\n  \n\n      Trump and Pence haven’t spoken in more than two years, and Pence has notably skipped a number of events with Trump as the keynote speaker, including the Faith and Freedom annual conference, where Trump mocked his former right-hand.\n  \n\n      “Mike Pence had a chance to be great, he had a chance to be frankly historic,” Trump said to the event audience, largely comprised of evangelicals that once served as Pence’s base. “But Mike did not have the courage to act.”\n  \n\n      Despite the avalanche of attacks from Trump over Pence’s decision to certify the 2020 presidential election, Pence has maintained he did the right thing.\n  \n\n      “President Trump was wrong,” Pence said recently at the annual Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington. “I had no right to overturn the election. And his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day. And I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.”\n  \n\n      In recent weeks, some sources close to Trump have said that the former president’s private rhetoric about Pence has softened and noted his jabs at Pence over the 2020 election are often followed by compliments for his former vice president. \n  \n\n      Some close to Trump have even floated the idea of Trump-Pence 2024 ticket, though Trump himself has publicly ruled such a prospect out.\n  \n\n      “That seems very unlikely,” a source close to Pence told CNN.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n\n      On Monday, the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee — chaired by Donald Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan — is set to hold a field hearing in New York City called “Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan.” A statement bills the hearing as an examination of how, the Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s policies have “led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.” \n  \n\n      In response, Bragg’s office slammed Jordan’s hearing as “a political stunt” while noting that data released by the New York Police Department shows crime is down in Manhattan with respect to murders, burglaries, robberies and more through April 2, compared with the same period last year. \n  \n\n      In reality, this Jordan-led hearing isn’t about stopping crime but about defending Trump — who was recently charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies. Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. The former president also is facing criminal probes in other jurisdictions over efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.  \n  \n\nBragg sued Jordan and his committee last week in federal court, accusing the Judiciary Committee chairman of a “transparent campaign to intimidate and attack” his office for its investigation and prosecution of Trump by making demands for confidential documents and testimony.\n  \n\n      While Jordan and his committee appear focused on discrediting the investigation into Trump, why aren’t they looking into two recent bombshell reports by ProPublica that raised red flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After all, the House Judiciary Committee’s website explains that it has jurisdiction over “matters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts” – for which the revelations concerning Thomas fit perfectly. \n  \n\nThe Clarence Thomas revelations are the last straw. It's time for Congress to act\n\n\n      First, we learned in early April that Crow had provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, for decades with luxurious vacations including on the donor’s yacht and private jet to faraway places such as Indonesia and New Zealand. That information was never revealed to the public. (In a rare public statement, Thomas responded he was advised at the time that he did not have to report the trips. The justice said the guidelines for reporting personal hospitality have changed recently. “And, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future,” he said.)  \n  \n\n      Then on Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas failed to disclose a 2014 real estate deal involving the sale of three properties he and his family owned in Savannah, Georgia, to that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One of Crow’s companies made the purchases for $133,363, according to ProPublica. A federal disclosure law passed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices and other officials to make public the details of most real estate sales over $1,000.  \n  \n\n      As ProPublica detailed, the federal disclosure form Thomas filed for that year included a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, but Thomas left that space blank. Four ethics law experts told ProPublica that Thomas’ failure to report it appears to be a violation of the law. (Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica on its report; CNN reached out to the Supreme Court and Thomas for comment.)\n  \n\nThomas revelation of gifts fits a broader pattern of financial nondisclosure from the Supreme Court\n\n\n      The House Judiciary Committee has long addressed issues such as those surrounding Thomas. In fact, the committee is where investigations and the impeachment of federal judges often commence.\n  \n\n      One recent example came in 2010 with Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., whom the committee investigated and recommended for impeachment.\n  \n\nThe committee’s Task Force on Judicial Impeachment said evidence showed Porteous “intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings.” The Senate later found Porteous guilty of four articles of impeachment and removed him from the bench.\n  \n\n      Yet the Judiciary Committee has neither released statements nor tweets raising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead, its Twitter feed is filled with repeated tweets whining that C-SPAN won’t cover Monday’s New York field hearing. Worse, the committee retweeted GOP Rep. Mary Miller’s tweet defending Thomas as being attacked “because he is a man of deep faith, who loves our country and believes in our Constitution.”\n  \n\n      Jordan’s use of his committee to assist Trump should surprise no one. The House January 6 committee’s report called the Ohio Republican “a significant player in President Trump’s efforts” to overturn the election. The report detailed the lawmaker’s efforts to assist Trump including on “January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan led a conference call in which he, President Trump, and other Members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session.” As a result, the January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan to testify — but he refused to cooperate. \n  \n\nSign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n\n      In contrast with the House panel, the Senate Judiciary Committee — headed by Democrats — announced in the wake of the reporting on Thomas that it plans to hold a hearing “on the need to restore confidence in the Supreme Court’s ethical standards.” Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia sent a letter Friday calling for a referral of Thomas to the US attorney general over “potential violations of the Ethics in Government Act 1978.”  \n  \n\n      The House Judiciary Committee’s website notes, “The Committee on the Judiciary has been called the lawyer for the House of Representatives.” Under Jordan that description needs to be updated to state that the Committee on the Judiciary is now “the lawyer for Donald J. Trump.” And the worst part is that the taxpayers are the ones paying for Jordan’s work on Trump’s behalf.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Follow the latest US political news here or read through the updates below.\nFrom CNN's Jeremy Herb \n\n\nTuesday’s arraignment of former President Donald Trump was a whirlwind of historic firsts. \nNow the wait begins for the long slog of the judicial system to play out, with the next scheduled actions in court months away. \nAway from the courthouse, however, Trump quickly went back to attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Judge Juan Merchan, along with their families – raising questions about whether his rhetoric could land him in hot water legally.\nHere’s what’s next in Trump’s New York criminal case: During Tuesday’s arraignment, prosecutors said they were negotiating the logistics of a “protective order” with Trump’s defense team, which would limit how Trump and his attorneys can use the documents they will be given from the grand jury proceedings during the discovery process.\nProsecutors specifically said they want to prohibit Trump from posting any discovery materials to social media or sharing them with third parties, such as journalists. They also said they plan to allow Trump to review certain sensitive materials only with his lawyers.\nTrump’s attorneys will have to agree to the specifics of the agreement, but the exchanges showed the concern in the district attorney’s office about what Trump might say or post about the evidence they hand over.\nWhen could a trial actually start? If the case goes to trial, it’s not going to be until next year — when Trump could be in the thick of the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\nMerchan set an August 8 deadline for Trump’s lawyers to file motions in the case — such as an attempt to get the charges dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors. Prosecutors will have until September 19 to respond, and then Merchan expects to rule on the motions at the December hearing.\nThe next hearing date for the case is December 4. \nProsecutors asked Merchan to plan on a trial beginning in January 2024, but Trump’s attorneys suggested that the spring might be more realistic, given they had not yet received any documents in the case.\nMerchan seemed to side with Trump’s lawyers.\n“I understand what you are saying,” Merchan said. “I think that is reasonable. You have not received discovery. It is difficult to anticipate if you will be ready for trial in January of 2024. The message I would like to deliver is we would like to move ahead as expeditiously as possible, without undue delay.”\nRead more. \nFrom CNN's MJ Lee\nThe former Trump World Tower doorman referenced in case documents accompanying former President Donald Trump’s unsealed indictment told CNN Wednesday he was in “complete shock” to learn of his involvement in the charges brought against Trump. \nThe comments made to CNN mark Sajudin’s first statement to the media since the unsealing of Trump’s indictment Tuesday.\nAccording to the statement of facts that accompanied the indictment, AMI – the publisher of National Inquirer – sought to silence a former Trump World Tower doorman who claimed to have knowledge about an alleged affair between Trump and an ex-housekeeper.\nAMI purchased the information from the doorman “without fully investigating his claims,” and at a later date “concluded that the story was not true,” it said. \nWhile “the Doorman” is not named in the documents, Sajudin told CNN in April 2018: \"I can confirm that while working at Trump World Tower I was instructed not to criticize President Trump's former housekeeper due to a prior relationship she had with President Trump which produced a child.\" \nHis suggestion that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock with an ex-housekeeper was not verified by CNN. \nCNN reported later in 2018 that Sajudin had been released from his contract with AMI. A copy of the signed “source agreement” obtained at the time appeared to have been signed in November 2015, and stated that AMI had exclusive rights to Sajudin’s story “regarding Donald Trump’s illegitimate child.”\nFrom CNN's Brian Rokus \nFormer President Donald Trump thanked the court staff and police officers involved in his arraignment in Manhattan Tuesday.\n“Court attendants, Police Officers, and others were all very professional, and represented New York City sooo well. Thank you to all,\" Trump said in a statement the day after his arraignment. \nTrump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in a historic and unprecedented court appearance Tuesday.\nProsecutors allege Trump sought to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election through a hush money scheme with payments made to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump.\nFrom CNN's Manu Raju, Morgan Rimmer, Nicky Robertson and Annie Grayer\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers, both allies and critics of former President Donald Trump, issued statements following the former president's arraignment on Tuesday. \nTrump pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan court to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree after hearing charges against him stemming from a hush money payment to an adult film actress in 2016.\nHere's how lawmakers are reacting:\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of seeking to interfere in the elections and said Congress will hold him accountable.\n“Alvin Bragg is attempting to interfere in our democratic process by invoking federal law to bring politicized charges against President Trump, admittedly using federal funds, while at the same time arguing that the peoples’ representatives in Congress lack jurisdiction to investigate this farce. Not so. Bragg’s weaponization of the federal justice process will be held accountable by Congress,” McCarthy tweeted.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has not spoken out.\nGOP Sen. Mitt Romney, a sharp Trump critic, criticized what he called Bragg’s overreach, saying it sets a \"dangerous precedent.\"\n\"I believe President Trump’s character and conduct make him unfit for office,\" Romney said in a statement. \"Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda. No one is above the law, not even former presidents, but everyone is entitled to equal treatment under the law. The prosecutor’s overreach sets a dangerous precedent for criminalizing political opponents and damages the public’s faith in our justice system.\"\nHouse GOP Chair Elise Stefanik, a key Trump ally, called Trump's arrest “shameful,” adding that it would help him in his bid for the White House. \n“President Trump continues to skyrocket in the polls, and just like with the Russia hoax and both sham impeachments, President Trump will defeat the latest witch-hunt, defeat Joe Biden, and will be sworn in as President of the United States in January 2025,” she said in a statement.\nHouse Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan tweeted Tuesday, “equal justice under the law, unless you’re a Republican running for president,” after Trump was arraigned. \nWhen asked on Fox News on Wednesday if he will subpoena Bragg, Jordan said that some lawmakers do want to talk to the district attorney. “He’s asked what questions we have,” Jordan said, referring to the correspondence he has had with Bragg’s office so far. “So I think he’s almost conceding the point that we should be able to talk to him. Everything is on the table. We are going to figure out how we proceed next. But we do want some answers to some key questions.”\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise retweeted Jordan’s post.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said that he will have a call with McCarthy and Jordan “this week” to discuss how to move forward with their investigation Bragg.\n“And we are going to try to figure out a path moving forward. This is very serious,” Comer told Fox and Friends on Wednesday, “We are not going to stop on this. Nothing changed. We believe he has overstepped.”\nTrump ally Sen. Marsha Blackburn accused Bragg of being politically motivated in his investigation in a number of tweets. In one post, Blackburn called Bragg a “radical left-wing activist abusing his power in an attempt to help Biden remain in office.”\nGOP Sen. JD Vance tweeted that “Bragg’s entire career is about normalizing violent crime. Just crazy that he’s bringing this weak case in the middle of a presidential election.” The Ohio senator, who was once a Trump critic, has embraced Trump and already endorsed him in the 2024 presidential race. \nGOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is weighing a 2024 presidential run, slammed Bragg ahead of the indictment, saying that he “doesn’t prosecute criminals, yet weaponizes the law against his political enemies.”\nGOP Rep. Nancy Mace, whose primary opponent former President Trump endorsed last cycle, tweeted that his indictment is “bs” and “clearly political prosecution.”\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune aligned himself with other GOP lawmakers who call Bragg's case politically motivated. \"This indictment looks like a political agenda run amok, and it’s becoming increasingly clear why previous district attorneys opted against prosecution,\" Thune said in a statement.\nFrom CNN's Zachary B. Wolf\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is involved in four different criminal investigations by three different levels of government – the Manhattan district attorney, the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney, and the Department of Justice.\nDespite being indicted in the New York case, he can still absolutely run for president.\n“Nothing stops Trump from running while indicted, or even convicted,” the University of California, Los Angeles law professor Richard Hasen told CNN in an email.\nThe Constitution requires only three things of candidates. They must be:\nAs a political matter, it’s maybe more difficult for an indicted candidate, who could become a convicted criminal, to win votes. Trials don’t let candidates put their best foot forward. But it is not forbidden for them to run or be elected.\nThere are a few asterisks both in the Constitution and the 14th and 22nd Amendments, none of which currently apply to Trump.\nTerm limits: The 22nd Amendment forbids anyone who has twice been president (meaning twice been elected or served half of someone else’s term and then won his or her own) from running again. That doesn’t apply to Trump since he lost the 2020 election.\nImpeachment: If a person is impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate of high crimes and misdemeanors, he or she is removed from office and disqualified from serving again. Trump, although twice impeached by the House during his presidency, was also twice acquitted by the Senate.\nDisqualification: The 14th Amendment includes a “disqualification clause,” written specifically with an eye toward former Confederate soldiers.\nIt reads:\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\nThe indictment in New York City with regard to the hush-money payment to an adult-film star has nothing to do with rebellion or insurrection. Nor do potential federal charges with regard to classified documents.\nPotential charges in Fulton County, Georgia, with regard to 2020 election meddling or at the federal level with regard to the January 6, 2021, insurrection could perhaps be construed by some as a form of insurrection. But that is an open question that would have to work its way through the courts. The 2024 election is fast approaching.\nNotably, if he was convicted of a felony in New York, Trump would be barred from voting in his adoptive home state of Florida, at least until he had served out a potential sentence.\nFrom CNN's Manu Raju\nSeveral top House and Senate Democrats are staying away from commenting on the merits of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case against Donald Trump, underscoring the belief among party leaders that it makes more political sense to steer clear from the high-profile proceeding.\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat, has not issued a statement after the indictment. And when asked by a local reporter in New York yesterday, Jeffries had a muted response, saying that they should \"follow the facts\" and see \"what the legal process yields.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer issued a statement yesterday afternoon before the indictment was unsealed, saying that he believes Trump will have a \"fair trial\" and that there should be no \"outside influence or intimidation\" of the legal process. He hasn't commented since the charges were unveiled.\nSome Democrats believe it doesn't benefit them to align themselves with the case, given the questions many legal experts have raised about its merits, aides say, plus adding their voice in defending Bragg could only give Republicans ammunition to contend the case is political. \nWhile many Democrats have been silent, some rank-and-file Democrats have issued statements praising Bragg and criticizing Trump. \nRep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on House Judiciary, praised the indictment as \"well-reasoned\" and criticized Republicans for trying to \"obstruct\" the probe by seeking Bragg's testimony.\nFrom CNN's Jeremy Herb, Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle\n\n\nWhile he was warned by Judge Juan Merchan during Tuesday’s arraignment not to make comments that could “jeopardize the rule of law” or create civil unrest, former President Donald Trump railed later that evening against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the judge himself.\nThe indictment returned last week by a grand jury against Trump was unsealed Tuesday and provided the public – and Trump’s legal team – with the first details about the specific charges he will face.\nWhile there had been some discussion about Trump speaking to the media while in the courthouse Tuesday, he did not do so. Instead, Trump responded at his event at Mar-a-Lago that night, making his first on-camera remarks while surrounded by supporters.\nTrump has consistently denied all wrongdoing and condemned the indictment as political persecution.\nSome of Trump’s comments came to the fore during the arraignment when prosecutors handed the judge a packet of Trump’s social media postings and informed the court that Trump was making threats with “irresponsible” social media posts, specifically citing Trump’s sharing of an article that showed a photo of Trump with a baseball bat.\nTrump’s attorneys responded that Trump has First Amendment rights and said that he was expressing his frustration with alleged illegal leaks about the indictment from the district attorney’s office. Trump’s lawyers also claimed that Trump’s social media posts were not threatening.\nJudge Merchan acknowledged Trump’s right to free speech, but warned both sides about making comments with the potential to “incite violence, create civil unrest or jeopardize the safety or well-being of any individuals.”\nNeither side made a request for a gag order.\nDespite the judge’s comments, Trump in his speech Tuesday evening claimed he had a “Trump-hating judge” in the New York case. Trump also attacked Bragg and the indictment – as well as the other prosecutors investigating him, President Joe Biden and additional political opponents.\n“This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election. And it should be dropped immediately,” Trump said.\nBragg’s indictment marks the first criminal charges against Trump, but it’s not the only potential legal trouble in front of the former president: Special counsel Jack Smith is still moving forward with an investigation into Trump’s role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. And a Fulton County special grand jury has completed its investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\nFrom CNN's Sydney Kashiwagi\n\n\nAlvin Bragg, a former New York state and federal prosecutor, drew national attention when he made history as the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office first Black district attorney. Now, he is back in the spotlight after a grand jury voted to indict Donald Trump after a yearslong investigation into the former president’s alleged role in a hush money scheme.\nIn Bragg’s first comments following Trump's Tuesday arraignment, he called the charges the “bread and butter” of his office’s work.\n“At its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white collar cases,” he said.\nHere's what you need to know about the official:\nThe Harvard-educated attorney previously served as an assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York, worked as a civil rights lawyer and as a professor and co-director of the New York Law School Racial Justice Project, where he represented family members of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after being placed in an unauthorized chokehold by a then-police officer, in a lawsuit against the City of New York seeking information.\nBragg has aggressively pursued Trump and other progressive priorities so far in his tenure, including not prosecuting some low-level crimes and finding alternatives to incarceration.\nBefore Bragg’s swearing-in last year, he had already worked on cases related to Trump and other notable names in his role as a New York state chief deputy attorney general.\nHe said he had helped sue the Trump administration more than 100 times, as well as led a team that sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which resulted in the former president paying $2 million to a number of charities and the foundation’s dissolution.\nBragg also led the suit against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein and his company, which alleged a hostile work environment.\nBragg emerged the winner in a crowded Democratic primary in the summer of 2021 to lead the coveted Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, for which Vance had announced earlier that year he would not seek reelection. While campaigning, he often spoke about his experience growing up in Harlem, saying he was once a 15-year-old stopped “numerous times at gunpoint by police.”\nBragg ran as a reformer, releasing a memo just days after taking office detailing new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies – a plan that drew criticism from police union leaders. He said his office would not prosecute marijuana misdemeanors, fare evading and prostitution, among other crimes.\n \nFrom CNN's Tierney Sneed, Hannah Rabinowitz, Katelyn Polantz, Fredreka Schouten, Holmes Lybrand and Devan Cole\n\n\nIn the historic criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump, Manhattan prosecutors are accusing Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges on Tuesday. Here’s a breakdown of the charges and evidence:\nProsecutors point to Trump’s \"unlawful\" election influence scheme as backing for felony charges\nDistrict Attorney Alvin Bragg during a news conference after Trump's arraignment said the business records were falsified in 2017 with the intent of concealing criminal conduct connected to the 2016 campaign. He referenced a New York state law that makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means.\nBragg is not charging Trump with a violation of election law or a conspiracy related to that alleged campaign-related conduct. The indictment says for all 34 counts that Trump had the “intent to defraud and intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof.”\nTrump and Cohen worked out repayment deal in the Oval Office, prosecutors say\nIn describing the alleged election influence scheme, the charging documents go into detail about how the plan to silence women accusing Trump of extramarital affairs allegedly came about.\nAccording to the charging documents, Cohen negotiated a hush-money payment with Daniels to “secure\" her \"silence and prevent disclosure of the damaging information in the final weeks before the presidential election.” Trump allegedly hid the reimbursement payments to Cohen by marking monthly checks for “legal services,” according to the statement of facts, in a deal the two worked out in the Oval Office.\nSome payments central to Trump’s charges came directly from his bank account\nProsecutors say checks were cut monthly – including some coming directly from Trump’s bank account – to Cohen. They allege these were disguised as attorney payments when they were not.\nParticipants in the alleged scheme knew payoffs were unlawful, prosecutors say\nAccording to the legal theory Bragg is pushing, what makes the falsified business records a felony is an underlying federal campaign finance crime that Trump is accused of trying to conceal. The district attorney also claims that state election law was violated with the scheme.\nThe statement of facts points to court filings in the federal investigation into the hush-money payments to assert that the participants in the alleged illegal scheme, including Cohen, have admitted the payoffs to the two women were unlawful.\nRead the full story here.\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience."

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position. \nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.” \nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies. \nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped. \nFrom CNN's Jeff Zeleny \nDonald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case.\nBut that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.\nIt’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked.\nFrom CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee \n\n\nAlina Habba, who represents Donald Trump in several civil matters, spent time with the former president in New York today and said, “He’s in good spirits. Honestly, he’s as he normally would be. He’s ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow.”\nHabba — appearing on on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters” — was asked about the “game plan” for Trump’s appearance in court in Manhattan Tuesday and said, “It’s all mapped out.”\nShe added, “Barring any surprises, I think that it should be smooth. We’re trying to coordinate and cooperate with everybody to make sure that there are no problems.”\nOn whether Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan, Habba said, “No, no. I think it’s very difficult. I’d like to have faith in this state, but I’ve been practicing for him now for a couple years and gone to court in New York for a few years, and I can tell you, it’s not the same as representing anybody else.\"\nFrom CNN's Kristen Holmes\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump met with his attorneys Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina at Trump Tower after arriving in New York City Monday, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. \nIt is unclear if the newest addition to Trump’s New York legal team, Todd Blanche, attended the meeting.\nTrump is expected to be arraigned Tuesday. \nFrom CNN's Photo Desk\nFormer President Donald Trump has landed in New York's La Guardia Airport ahead of his expected Tuesday arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse. \nHistory was made Thursday when he was indicted by a New York grand jury. It's the first time that a current or former US president has been criminally charged.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office has been investigating Trump's alleged role in a hush money payment scheme and cover-up involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump's attorney said he plans to file \"substantial\" legal challenges. The former president has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in the matter and accused Democrats of targeting him politically.\nSee more photos of the days leading up to Trump's indictment:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Jeff Zeleny\n\nA small group of supporters chanted as former President Donald Trump arrived at his namesake tower on Monday afternoon, with a handful of people waving banners with messages like “Trump won” and “Arrest Biden.”\nWhile Trump couldn’t see his admirers as he entered a side door on 56th Street, his arrival came with more fanfare and security than at any other time in his post presidency.\nNow that he is inside the building — where he launched his presidential bid nearly eight years ago — Trump is expected to meet with lawyers and political advisers on the eve of his arraignment, an aide told CNN. \nTrump's mood was described by an adviser as “defiant and focused,” as he watched expansive television coverage while flying back to his native New York City from Florida. \nFrom CNN's Katelyn Polantz and Evan Perez\nSpecial counsel prosecutors have secured evidence including daily notes, texts, emails and photographs and are focused on cataloging how Donald Trump handled classified records around the Mar-a-Lago resort and those who may have witnessed the former president with them, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation.\nThe new details come amid signs the Justice Department is taking steps that are typically near the end of an investigation.\nThe recent investigative activity before a federal grand jury in Washington, DC, also includes subpoenaing witnesses in March and April who had previously spoken to investigators, the sources said. While the FBI interviewed many aides and workers at Mar-a-Lago nearly a year ago voluntarily, grand jury appearances are transcribed and under oath — an indication the prosecutors are locking in witness testimony.\nThe focus of both the mishandling of records and obstruction of justice probes has remained on the actions of the former president, the sources say. That includes prosecutors pursuing evidence of Trump's intent to keep classified records after he left the White House, plus his knowledge that the records remained in his possession after the Justice Department demanded their return last May.\nWitnesses are being questioned about what they saw in Trump's private residential and work areas within the club, some of the sources said.\nRead more about this here.\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience."

                "content": "\n      The Justice Department on Friday asked the Supreme Court to take up an appeals court ruling that struck down a Trump-era federal ban on so-called bump stocks. \n  \n\n      The request comes as the high court has repeatedly declined to disturb those rulings that favor the restriction on the device, including not considering a challenge to the federal ban in October. Bump stocks are attachments that essentially allow shooters to fire semiautomatic rifles continuously with one pull of the trigger.\n  \n\n      “Like other machineguns, rifles modified with bump stocks are exceedingly dangerous; Congress prohibited the possession of such weapons for good reason.” US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the new filing with the Supreme Court. “The decision below contradicts the best interpretation of the statute, creates an acknowledged circuit conflict, and threatens significant harm to public safety.”\n  \n\n      The January appellate court ruling concluded that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, did not have the authority to classify the devices as machine guns, a classification that had effectively banned them. But in the new filing, the Justice Department argued that prior to the ruling, three other appeals courts had upheld the bump stock regulation.\n  \n\n      In 2018, the ATF classified the devices as machine guns under the National Firearms Act after then-President Donald Trump ordered a review of bump stocks – which were used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting a few months prior. \n  \n\n      But the appellate majority in January argued that bump stocks were not covered by the law. \n  \n\n      “A plain reading of the statutory language, paired with close consideration of the mechanics of a semi-automatic firearm, reveals that a bump stock is excluded from the technical definition of ‘machinegun’ set forth in the Gun Control Act and National Firearms Act,” Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote in the majority’s opinion.\n  \n\n      In 2010, the ATF had determined that bump stocks were merely accessories, or firearms parts – and therefore not regulated as a firearm.\n  \n\n      But following the Las Vegas shooting that killed over 50 people and injured hundreds, the Justice Department said that the “devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger,” similar to automatic rifles. \n  \n\n  CNN’s Ariane de Vogue, Devan Cole and Jason Hanna contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      A federal judge on Wednesday denied a request by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office for a temporary restraining order to stop a House Judiciary Committee subpoena of former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz.\n  \n\n      District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil said Pomerantz must appear for a deposition as the House panel investigates Bragg’s recent indictment of former President Donald Trump. Pomerantz was initially set to testify before the committee on Thursday, but a federal appeals court delayed his testimony to allow for a three-judge panel to hear arguments on a stay pending trial.\n  \n\n      Pomerantz did not respond to a request for comment.\n  \n\n      “The subpoena was issued with a ‘valid legislative purpose’ in connection with the ‘broad’ and ‘indispensable’ congressional power to ‘conduct investigations.’ It is not the role of the federal judiciary to dictate what legislation Congress may consider or how it should conduct its deliberations in that connection. Mr. Pomerantz must appear for the congressional deposition. No one is above the law,” Vyskocil wrote after hearing arguments in court on the matter earlier in the day.\n  \n\n      Bragg’s office says it will appeal, though Vyskocil on Wednesday night denied Bragg’s request to pause her ruling while the appeals process plays out.\n  \n\n      In her ruling, Vyskocil said that she “does not endorse” the agenda of Bragg or the House Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan.\n  \n\nFormer Manhattan attorney says 'many bits and pieces of evidence' exist to charge Trump \n\n\n      “In our federalist system, elected state and federal actors sometimes engage in political dogfights. Bragg complains of political interference in the local DANY (District attorney of New York) case, but Bragg does not operate outside of the political arena. Bragg is presumptively acting in good faith. That said, he is an elected prosecutor in New York County with constituents, some of whom wish to see Bragg wield the force of law against the former President and a current candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,” Vyskocil wrote.\n  \n\n      “Jordan, in turn, has initiated a political response to what he and some of his constituents view as a manifest abuse of power and nakedly political prosecution, funded (in part) with federal money, that has the potential to interfere with the exercise of presidential duties and with an upcoming federal election,” the judge added.\n  \n\n      Vyskocil reinforced her point in court that it is not her place to consider potential motivations of either side. \n  \n\n      “The Court is further unmoved by Bragg’s purported concern at the prospect of ‘inject[ing] partisan passions’ into a forum where they do not belong,” Vyskocil said. “By bringing this action, Bragg is engaging in precisely the type of political theater he claims to fear.”\n  \n\n      In her ruling, Vyskocil ruled that the district attorney waived the right to privilege over any information in Pomerantz’s book because Bragg’s office didn’t take any legal action before or after the publication of “Inside Account.”\n  \n\n      “While Bragg maintains that Pomerantz’s inappropriate disclosures cannot waive DANY’s privilege, such a claim is belied by DANY’s inaction in response to Pomerantz’s known plan to publish a book about DANY’s investigation into President Trump. If that information ever was protected from disclosure as attorney work product, the protection has been waived by DANY. Bragg concedes that he was aware of Pomerantz’s intention to publish the book before it was published,” the judge wrote.\n  \n\n      Vyskocil also said Pomerantz, who is a named defendant in the suit, ultimately got himself into the sticky situation that’s made national headlines. \n  \n\n      “The Court notes that Pomerantz is in this situation because he decided to inject himself into the public debate by authoring a book that he has described as ‘appropriate and in the public interest,’” she added.\n  \n\n      During the hearing, an attorney for Bragg’s office argued – unsuccessfully – that Pomerantz ignored cautions from the DA before publishing the book, so the district attorney’s office should not be penalized.\n  \n\n      “No, I think there are things contained in there that should not have been published and that exposed Mr. Pomerantz to criminal liability under the city charter,” attorney Leslie Dubeck said. “He has not waived our privileges and confidences because they were unauthorized disclosures.”\n  \n\n      Vyskocil acknowledged the stakes of the case during the hearing with lawyers from Bragg’s office and the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n  \n\n      “There’s politics going on on both sides, let’s be honest about that,” she said.\n  \n\n      But the judge, who was appointed to the bench by Trump and confirmed by the Senate in 2019, said she views her task narrowly as determining whether there is valid legislative purpose for the Judiciary Committee’s subpoena of Pomerantz.\n  \n\n      “I’m talking about the subpoena. That’s what’s in front of me, not all the political rhetoric that’s been flying back and forth that’s all color, it’s all theater but it’s not what’s in front of me,” the judge said.\n  \n\n      In her ruling, Vyskocil said the committee and Jordan had in fact identified several valid legislative purposes underlying the subpoena.\n  \n\n      “There can be no doubt that Congress may permissibly investigate the use of federal funds,” Vyskocil wrote, noting that counsel for Bragg’s office conceded that it used federal forfeiture funds in its investigation of Trump. \n  \n\n      The judge also said the committee’s potential to draft legislation from their inquiry is a valid legislative purpose.\n  \n\n      “The Court will not, and indeed cannot, block congressional investigation into hypothetical future legislation based on Bragg’s speculation that such legislation would not pass constitutional muster,” the judge wrote.\n  \n\n      During the hearing, lawyers for Bragg’s office had conceded that the use of federal funding is a valid legislative purpose but argued $5,000 in federal funds were used in the Trump Organization tax fraud case that ended in a conviction in December, not the indictment of the former president himself.\n  \n\n      The Judiciary Committee attorney during the hearing also described what the deposition in Washington, DC, might look like for the former prosecutor.\n  \n\n      “Mr. Pomerantz is free to assert privilege if he shows up tomorrow with respect to particular questions, then the committee can ask questions to elicit the basis of privilege and they can adjudicate them on a question-by-question basis,” the committee attorney said.\n  \n\n      Committee Chairman Jordan would ultimately be the decider of whether to allow Pomerantz to assert his privilege, the attorney acknowledged.\n  \n\n      Bragg, a Democrat, sued Jordan, last week to block the subpoena to a former prosecutor, alleging the lawmakers are engaged in a “transparent campaign to intimidate and attack” the DA’s office. \n  \n\nHouse GOP escalates defense of Trump with New York field hearing seeking to discredit Manhattan DA\n\n\n      Bragg is seeking judge for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to block this subpoena and any future subpoenas to him or other current or former prosecutors. \n  \n\n      The lawsuit followed weeks of heated exchanges between Jordan and Bragg leading up to and following the indictment of Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records that was allegedly done to coverup a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public about an alleged affair a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n  \n\n      The clash between federal and state powers began in March when Jordan asked Bragg’s office for documents and communications after news organizations reported that Bragg’s office was moving closer to seeking to indict Trump. Jordan called it an “unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.” Bragg’s office has alleged that a Trump attorney worked behind the scenes to enlist help from allies in Congress and called Jordan’s inquiry into the ongoing criminal investigation an unconstitutional and “unprecedented inquiry into a local prosecution.” \n  \n\n      Bragg’s lawsuit describes Jordan’s efforts as “a direct threat to federalism and the sovereign interests of the State of New York.”  \n  \n\n      Lawyers for Jordan and the committee said they are immune from the civil lawsuit under the Speech and Debate clause of the US Constitution that protects lawmakers from being sued for actions stemming from their legislative actions. They have also argued the subpoena is valid because they are seeking the information to potentially craft legislation that would protect a president from politically motivated state and local prosecutions and allow them to move criminal actions to federal courts. \n  \n\n      In a proposed response filed with the court, Bragg argues that constitutional immunity assumes the actions are part of legitimate legislative activity, which he argues the subpoena isn’t. \n  \n\n      “Speech or Debate immunity is not license for Congress to disregard the very separation of powers the clause aims to secure,” he wrote. \n  \n\n      Pomerantz has joined Bragg in asking the judge to block the subpoena for his testimony, saying he was not involved in the decision to seek an indictment of Trump since he resigned more than a year before the indictment was returned.   \n  \n\n      Before Vyskocil was confirmed as a US district court judge, she was appointed as a federal bankruptcy judge in 2016 by the Judicial Council of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Prior to that, Vyskocil was a litigator who worked primarily on insurance cases over a 33-year career at New York law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. She attended Dominican College of Blauvelt and received her law degree from St. John’s University. \n  \n\n      The judge had a notable ruling in September 2020 when she dismissed a defamation lawsuit that former Playboy model Karen McDougal brought against Fox News alleging she was defamed by host Tucker Carlson when he suggested she extorted Trump when she obtained a $150,000 payment from American Media, the publisher of the National Enquirer, for her life story, which included allegations of a long affair with Trump. AMI never published an article and said McDougal was paid to write health and fitness columns. \n  \n\nTakeaways and key lines from the indictment against Donald Trump \n\n\n      The judge ruled, “The context in which the offending statements were made here make it abundantly clear that Mr. Carlson was not accusing Ms. McDougal of actually committing a crime. As a result, his statements are not actionable.” \n  \n\n      “But there can be no doubt that Mr. Carlson did so as hyperbole to promote debate on a matter of public concern,” the judge wrote. \n  \n\n      Prosecutors did not charge Trump with crimes related to the AMI deal to buy and bury McDougal’s story, but they included it in a statement of facts accompanying the indictment as part of a “catch and kill scheme” to suppress negative stories before the 2016 presidential election. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\n      Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis plans to announce this summer whether she’ll bring charges against former President Donald Trump or his allies for their attempts to overturn Georgia’s 2020 presidential election results, according to a letter obtained by CNN.\n  \n\n      Willis told local law enforcement officials in a letter that she plans to make an announcement on possible charges between July 11 and September 1.\n  \n\n      The letter is another strong indication that Willis is seriously weighing bringing racketeering and conspiracy charges in connection with Trump’s actions in the Peach State around the 2020 election, as CNN has reported.   \n  \n\n      “I am providing this letter to bring to your attention the need for heightened security and preparedness in coming months due to this pending announcement,” Willis, a Democrat, wrote.\n  \n\nExclusive: Text messages reveal Trump operatives considered using breached voting data to decertify Georgia's Senate runoff in 2021\n\n\n      In the letter addressed to the Sheriff of Fulton County Patrick Labat, who is in charge of courthouse security, Willis said that “open-source intelligence” has previously indicated that decisions in this case could provoke “significant” public reaction that could result in “violence.”\n  \n\n      “Please accept this correspondence as notice to allow you sufficient time to prepare the Sheriff’s Office and coordinate with local, state, and federal agencies to ensure that our law enforcement community is ready to protect the public, Willis wrote in the letter. \n  \n\n      The Atlanta Journal-Constitution first reported the letter.\n  \n\n      CNN’s Ryan Young spoke with a police chief in metropolitan Atlanta who confirmed they also received a letter on Monday, detailing Willis’ desire for them to be prepared to assist with security and law enforcement preps ahead of any potential charges.  \n  \n\n      Fulton County’s fourth term of court is scheduled to begin on July 11, so Willis would bring any possible charging recommendations to the regularly seated grand juries, who each serve two-month terms, during that time frame.  \n  \n\n      Willis kicked off her sprawling investigation in early 2021 shortly after she took office, and soon after the infamous January phone call became public in which Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the votes necessary for Trump to win Georgia’s electoral votes.\n  \n\n      Investigators have at least three recordings of Trump pressuring Georgia officials, including a phone call that he made to the Georgia House speaker to push for a special legislative session to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the state.\n  \n\n      There is also a recording of Trump’s call to a top investigator with the Georgia Secretary of State’s office in December 2020, while they were looking into quashed allegations of irregularities with signature-matching in Cobb County in the Atlanta metropolitan area.\n  \n\n      The Fulton County probe expanded beyond the Trump phone calls to include false claims of election fraud to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county and threats and harassment against election workers. \n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

And it potentially portends well for Democrats’ 2024 fortunes.\n  \n\n      The result in Wisconsin sums up the Republican problem. Biden won the state by less than a point in 2020, after Trump had carried it by a similar margin four years earlier. The Badger State is one of a handful that has voted for the winner in the last four presidential elections, and it is one of few that has a US senator of each party.\n  \n\n      Protasiewicz’s 11-point winning margin over her Republican opponent is a relative blowout compared with Biden’s 2020 performance in Wisconsin.\n  \n\nLiberal judge's victory in Wisconsin Supreme Court race marks political shift in key swing state\n\n\n      We can also see the Democratic overperformance in Wisconsin in another Tuesday election, this one a state Senate election in the Milwaukee area. While not spoken about anywhere near as much as the state Supreme Court race, Republicans needed to hold the open seat to win a supermajority in the state Senate.\n  \n\n      The Republican candidate did win, but only by 2 points. This marked a 3-point overperformance for the Democratic nominee as Biden lost the district by 5 points in 2020.\n  \n\n      The Wisconsin results match up well with what we’ve seen so far in 2023 special election across the country. \n  \n\n      In the lone federal special election so far this year, Democrat Jennifer McCllean outperformed Biden’s 2020 margin in Virginia’s 4th Congressional District by 13 points.\n  \n\n      In the average of nearly 20 special state legislative elections, Democrats have done about 4 points better than Biden’s margin, on average.\n  \n\n      The president, of course, won the 2020 election, so the fact that the political environment looks to be better for Democrats now than it was then is a good sign for his party.\n  \n\n      It also marks a big difference with what we saw in 2019 when Democrats in special elections were nearly on par with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 margins. That came after Democrats overperformed Clinton in the 2018 midterms. It was a signal that the 2020 elections might be close.\n  \n\n      What makes the Democrats’ strong showings this year especially odd is that they are occurring with Biden’s approval rating stuck in the low 40s. Normally, you wouldn’t expect an unpopular president’s party to do so well in off-year elections.\n  \n\n      This suggests that the factors currently at play are similar to those in the latter half of 2022. Following the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade halfway through the year, Democrats started to outdo Biden’s 2020 margins in districts that held special elections.\n  \n\nDemocrats push abortion rights to the ballot in 2024, using an old GOP playbook\n\n\n      And Democrats had a historically exceptional night in the November midterms. They more than held their own, despite Biden’s approval rating being well south of 50%.\n  \n\n      The midterm exit polls revealed that many voters who didn’t like Biden or Trump voted Democratic. Almost all the key races in the states that will likely decide the presidency in 2024 went Democratic. Put another way, Biden wasn’t the deciding factor you might have expected him to be among swing voters. Trump factored into their vote too, even though he wasn’t president.\n  \n\n      Neither abortion nor Trump seem to be going away as an issue in 2023.\n  \n\n      Abortion was at the forefront of the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, with liberals hoping that a win by Protasiewicz would provide them with a majority to legalize the procedure statewide.\n  \n\n      And Trump remains the clear favorite for the GOP nomination for president, despite his indictment and continuing unpopularity among the general electorate.\n  \n\n      If those things don’t change going into 2024, Republicans may be in big trouble.\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

The DA’s office also accused the lawyer of failing to present an immunity deal to her clients last year, according to the filing.\n  \n\n      The new filing offers the latest indication that immunity offers could still be in the works months after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis suggested charging decisions were “imminent.” \n  \n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp urges Republicans to move on from election fraud claims: '2020 is ancient history'\n\n\n      It notes that investigators interviewed some of the fake GOP electors this month and there is jockeying behind the scenes ahead of the announcement on who, if anyone, will face charges in the long-running probe into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.\n  \n\n      “The statement of some of her clients that directly implicate another client in additional crimes shows that Ms. Debrow’s continued participation in this matter is fraught with conflicts of interest that rise to the level of her being disqualified from this case in its entirety,” the district attorney’s office wrote in the filing.\n  \n\n      During the April 2023 interviews, “some of the electors stated that another elector represented by Ms. Debrow committed acts that are violations of Georgia law and that they were not party to these additional acts,” according to the filing. \n  \n\n      Amid a fight last year to compel the fake electors to testify, the court instructed two attorneys, including Debrow, to inform their clients with potential immunity deals. The attorneys told the court that they spoke to their clients and none of the clients were interested, according to filing. Now the DA’s office is claiming those offers were never presented to the clients.\n  \n\n      “Additionally, in these interviews, some of the electors represented by Ms. Debrow told members of the investigation team that no potential offer of immunity was ever brought to them in 2022,” the filing states.\n  \n\n      Debrow slammed the latest motion in a statement.\n  \n\n      “The DA’s Motion is baseless, false, and offensive,” Debrow said. “None of my clients have committed any crimes, and they necessarily have not implicated themselves or each other in any crimes.” \n  \n\n      No one has been charged yet in the Georgia case, though several people – including the 16 fake electors and former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani – were informed they were potential targets of Willis’s probe.\n  \n\n      A special grand jury investigating the matter concluded its work late last year and recommended more than a dozen people should face charges, the foreperson for the panel said in interviews.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Brian Kemp on Saturday urged his fellow Republicans to move on from the 2020 presidential election, offering a thinly veiled dig at former President Donald Trump and his continued election grievances. \n  \n\n      Without naming Trump, Kemp’ said at a private Republican National Committee donor retreat in Nashville that “not a single swing voter in a single swing state will vote for our nominee if they choose to talk about the 2020 election being stolen.”\n  \n\n      “To voters trying to pay their rent … make their car payment … or put their kids through college … 2020 is ancient history,” Kemp said, according to his prepared remarks, which were obtained by CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n  \n\n      Trump, who announced his reelection campaign last fall, has repeatedly argued since leaving office that Republicans cannot have a successful future – either at the ballot box or legislatively – if they turn a blind eye to the past.\n  \n\n      Tension between Trump and Kemp has been simmering for years. When Kemp refused to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 win in Georgia, Trump made the governor his No. 1 enemy, publicly railing against him throughout 2021 and recruiting former US Sen. David Perdue to challenge Kemp in a GOP primary. Through it all, Trump failed to draw Kemp into a fight, and the governor won his 2022 primary overwhelmingly before handily defeating Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams in the November general election.\n  \n\n      Also in the midterm elections, candidates who backed Trump’s false election claims did poorly in key swing states the former president will need to win back the White House in 2024.\n  \n\nTrump campaign says it saw surge in donations after indictment\n\n\n      Further complicating Trump’s bid is a cloud of legal woes. In New York, a hush money payment to an adult-film star shortly before the 2016 election has resulted in his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury over his alleged role in the scheme – the first time in American history that a current or former president faces criminal charges.\n  \n\n      And in Atlanta, a select grand jury has investigated efforts by Trump and allies to overturn his election loss in Georgia in 2020.\n  \n\n      Kemp made direct mention of these investigations Saturday, according to his prepared remarks, calling the probes distractions that could take the Republican Party off course and away from issues voters care about. \n  \n\n      “Being distracted by what is happening at the Manhattan and Fulton County district attorney offices is not going to win us back the White House in 2024,” Kemp said. “The media and Democrats would love nothing more than for us to talk about this from sun-up to sundown until next November.”\n  \n\n      “But here’s the truth: Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg’s investigations into allegations of the past don’t help hardworking Americans battling high grocery prices, growing pain at the gas pump or violent crime plaguing their neighborhoods,” he continued, referring to the district attorneys of Fulton County, Georgia, and Manhattan respectively.\n  \n\n      “In fact, the person they help the most is Joe Biden.”\n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

                "content": "\nDonald Trump may be the first former US president to face criminal charges, but around the world many current and former leaders have been prosecuted or even spent time in jail.\n  \n\n      Many of those leaders denounced the accusations against them as politically-motivated. But charges have often not been a barrier to holding political office. \n  \n\n      Here are some notable recent examples. \n  \n\n      No one has served as Israeli prime minister longer than Benjamin Netanyahu, who was sworn in for his sixth term in the post late last year.\n  \n\n      The prime minister is also currently facing a corruption trial, on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. Some of the allegations assert that Netanyahu received gifts like cigars and champagne from overseas businessmen. \n  \n\n      Echoing some of the language used by Trump, Netanyahu has denied all the charges and called the trial a “witch hunt.” \n  \n\n      As the case rumbles on, Netanyahu has been pushing a controversial plan to weaken Israel’s judicary.\n\n\n      One of the measures includes limits on the ways a sitting prime minister can be declared unfit for office, leading to many Israeli opposition politicians claiming that Netanyahu is using the judicial overhaul to protect himself. He denies the accusations. \n  \n\n      Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was imprisoned in April 2018, spending a year and a half behind bars until his release in November 2019. \n  \n\n      He was sentenced for corruption and money laundering, after he and his wife allegedly received about $1.1 million in improvements and expenses from a construction company for a beachfront apartment.\n  \n\n      In exchange, prosecutors said, the company was able to obtain lucrative contracts from Petrobras, the state-controlled oil giant.\n  \n\n      Lula has called the charges a “farce,” claiming the charges were politically motivated. Following his release from prison in 2019, a Brazilian court threw out his corruption convictions, which allowed Lula to run in the 2022 presidential election where he defeated Jair Bolsonaro. He was sworn in as president for the third time in January.\n  \n\nIt is now Bolsonaro who faces potential legal problems, including accusations that he incited violent attacks in the capital, Brasilia, in January. \n  \n\n      Argentinian Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was sentenced to six years in prison last December after being found guilty of corruption during her two terms as president, from 2007 to 2011 and 2011 to 2015.\n  \n\n      She was accused of conspiring with other government officials to award contracts worth millions of dollars for road works that, according to the complaint, were incomplete, overpriced and unnecessary.\n  \n\n      Fernández de Kirchner has said the charges against her were politically-motivated. \n  \n\n      The Argentinian court found the 70-year-old, who had previously served as the country’s president, guilty of “fraudulent administration” and disqualified her from holding public office again. \n  \n\n      She does, though, have temporary immunity because of her current role, meaning she won’t be going to jail soon, and can appeal.\n  \n\n      In an extraordinary change in fortune, Anwar Ibrahim became Malaysian prime minister in November 2022 after two stints in prison prior to his premiership. \n  \n\n      Anwar was jailed in April 1999 after being convicted of sodomy. Even if consensual, sodomy is an offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison in Muslim-majority Malaysia. He has always strongly denied the charges, claiming they were politically motivated.\n  \n\n      That conviction was overturned by a court in 2004. After his return as an opposition figure, more allegations of sodomy were made against him and – following a protracted court battle that took place over a period of years – he returned to jail in 2014.\n  \n\n      Anwar received a royal pardon and was released from prison in May 2018. He quickly returned to parliament, before leading the Pakatan Harapan coalition to win a plurality of seats in the 2022 Malaysian general election. \n  \n\n      The flamboyant Italian tycoon was a serial prime minister until standing down in 2011. \n  \n\n      Berlusconi was the dominant figure in Italian politics for nearly two decades, a period which also saw him tried on at least 17 charges, involving allegations of embezzlement, tax fraud and bribery.\n  \n\n      He has always denied wrongdoing and many of the cases were overturned on appeal. \n  \n\n      It was not legal worries but Italy’s debt crisis that led to his 2011 resignation. \n  \n\n      After leaving office, Berlusconi was subsequently convicted of tax fraud, where he was sentenced to one year of community service at a nursing home, while a court overturned his conviction for paying for sex with an underage prostitute. \n  \n\n      Berlusconi was also found guilty of bribing a senator to change political factions, but did not serve prison time.\n  \n\n      In September 2022, the 81-year-old won a seat in Italy’s Senate and his party is part of Italy’s ruling coalition. \n  \n© 2023 Cable News Network.

Those texts and notes, which investigators have had for several months, detail what Trump was doing and who he was meeting with, which could be significant for understanding his whereabouts in relation to the documents. \n  \n\n      As CNN reported last month, at least two dozen people – from Mar-a-Lago resort staff to members of Trump’s inner circle at the Florida estate – have been subpoenaed to testify to a federal grand jury that’s investigating his handling of classified documents.\n  \n\n      The staffers are of interest to investigators because of what they may have seen or heard while carrying out their daily duties around the estate, including whether they saw boxes or documents in Trump’s office suite or elsewhere.\n  \n\n      The Justice Department has been investigating potential mishandling of national security records and possible obstruction for about a year. FBI agents recovered more than 100 classified documents during a search of Mar-a-Lago last summer. Since then, Trump’s legal team has turned over additional classified material.\n  \n\n      Officials involved in the investigation have also asked witnesses if Trump showed specific interest in documents or material related to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, the Post reported, but it’s unclear why.\n  \n\n  Kaitlan Collins and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report. \n\n© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

You can read more about Trump's indictment here, or scroll through the updates below.\nFrom CNN’s Aileen Graef\nFormer Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who was previously investigating former President Donald Trump, said Trump’s statements regarding current District Attorney Alvin Bragg have the potential to strengthen the case against him with an added obstruction charge. \n“I've got to say, I was disturbed to hear the former president speak in the way he spoke about the District Attorney Bragg and even the trial court in the past week,\" Vance said Sunday in an interview on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"\nVance said adding an obstruction count to the charge could \"change the jury's mind about the severity of the case that they're looking at.” \nFrom CNN's Gregory Clary\nSen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, said \"no one is above the law\" but called for transparency in the legal process regarding the indictment of former President Donald Trump.\nManchin said he did not believe the former president was being politically targeted — as numerous Republicans and the former president himself have alleged this weekend. But, the West Virginia lawmaker added: “You have to remove all doubt. You have to make sure; cross every ‘t,’ dot every ‘i,’ as they say.”\nTexas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw also appeared on State of the Union Sunday and slammed Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for what he described as inconsistent application of the law.\n“I think people need to ask themselves a fundamental question: If this were anyone but Trump, would this DA even take up this case?” Crenshaw said.\nCrenshaw said Bragg \"has a habit of not picking up cases that are pretty serious, like violent crime, prostitution rings, things like that, but he chooses to take up this one.\"\n\"It feels obvious to all of us that it’s politically motivated, it’s personally motivated,\" he added.\nHost Dana Bash noted Crenshaw was speculating, because the indictment against Trump has not been unsealed yet, and Crenshaw’s claims about Bragg’s prosecutorial decisions may not be accurate.\nSome context on Bragg: Bragg ran for district attorney as a reformer. He has aggressively pursued Trump and other progressive priorities since getting elected, including not prosecuting some low-level crimes and finding alternatives to incarceration for certain offenders.\nFrom CNN staff\nFormer President Donald Trump is mounting a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, even as several legal controversies swirl around him.\nTwo of his potential opponents in the GOP primary — who have not yet formally announced candidacies — took different tacks when discussing Trump's historic indictment this weekend. \nHere is what they had to say:\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for indicting “a former president on misdemeanor offenses” for “purely political purposes” in a speech Saturday at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference.\n“That is when you know that the law has been weaponized for political purposes; that is when you know that the left is using that to target their political opponent,” DeSantis said. \nDeSantis further attacked Bragg at a rally Saturday in Garden City, New York. \nDeSantis said while Bragg is looking to lessen penalties on other offenders, he's looking to charge Trump with a felony for business-related crimes that should be considered misdemeanors.\n“This guy is doing politics. He has an agenda. That is not the rule of law,” DeSantis continued, as the crowd broke into applause that turned into a standing ovation.\nContext on Bragg's campaign: Bragg ran for district attorney as a reformer. He has aggressively pursued Trump and other progressive priorities since getting elected, including not prosecuting some low-level crimes and finding alternatives to incarceration for certain offenders.\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, one of the few Republican 2024 hopefuls who did not immediately criticize Donald Trump's indictment, said late Friday that the former president “shouldn’t be the nominee” and “can’t win” the 2024 election.\nSununu said on HBO’s \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" that the historic indictment has created a “circus.”\nAsked if he thought Trump was guilty, the governor said: “You know what the indictments are? Like, I'm assuming he is, right?\"\nSununu said the indictment \"only helps\" Trump with his supporters, but he doesn't believe the former president should be the GOP's nominee in the 2024 presidential election.\nMore from the potential 2024 GOP field: You can read remarks on the indictment from former Vice President Mike Pence, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and other Republicans to watch here.\nFrom CNN’s Kristen Holmes\nFormer President Donald Trump will deliver remarks at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when he returns from his arraignment Tuesday night, according to a news release from his campaign.\nTrump is expected to appear in court Tuesday afternoon in Manhattan, sources tell CNN. \nHis attorney said the former president will voluntarily surrender to New York law enforcement and plans to mount legal challenges.\nFrom CNN’s Katelyn Polantz\nFormer President Donald Trump's legal team will make a robust response in court to try to challenge his indictment however it can once the charges are unsealed, Joe Tacopina, a Trump defense lawyer, said Sunday.\nTacopina and other Trump lawyers have done several TV interviews in anticipation of Trump's first appearance in court on Tuesday, when he will learn the charges the grand jury approved against him. \nTacopina said Trump will plead not guilty.\nAt times, the former president's lawyers have vowed to ask for the charges to be dismissed. They have consistently said they believe the charges will be thrown out. But the full slate remains under seal and still isn't known.\nAt the arraignment, a judge will ultimately determine if the law is sound enough for the case to move forward to trial.\nWhat a challenge could look like: The Trump team’s court challenge could center around the case's expected reliance on business record entries that prosecutors tie to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels seven years ago.\nTacopina suggested in TV interviews Sunday the statute of limitations may have passed on any alleged misconduct related to those transactions.\n“They’re not false entries. But assuming they were, they’re misdemeanors way beyond the statute of limitations, so they had to cobble them together to try and get a felony,” he said.\nTrump's legal team isn't currently considering asking to move the case to a different New York City borough, Tacopina said.\n“There’s been no discussion of that whatsoever,” he separately told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos in another interview Sunday. “It’s way too premature to start worrying about venue changes until we really see the indictment and grapple with the legal issues.”\nFrom CNN’s Jasmine Wright\nWilliam Barr, the former attorney general in the Trump administration, said on Fox News Sunday that it would not be wise for Donald Trump to testify in the criminal case against the former president.\nBarr said he believes the Trump indictment is an “abuse of the prosecutor function.\"\n“Based on what we know, it certainly appears to be (political prosecution) and I think the American people see that it's the very essence of the abuse of the prosecutor function, which is pursuing a person rather than pursuing a real crime,\" Barr said.\nHe added: “There's nothing inherently wrong or illegal about making a hush payment. They're saying he falsified the corporate record. But for that to even be a misdemeanor, you have to be trying to defraud somebody.\" \nThe former AG said it is \"unclear\" to him \"exactly who was defrauded” by Trump.\nCatching up on the case? You can read up on the details of the allegations against Trump, or learn more about Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the Republicans accusing him of leading a politically motivated prosecution.\nFrom CNN's Jorge Engels\nThe grand jury indictment of former US President Donald Trump was a \"vindication,\" \"monumental\" and \"epic,\" adult film star Stormy Daniels told the British newspaper, The Times.\nDaniels also said she received a torrent of abuse within hours of the indictment and that for the first time, she is scared.\nDaniels was supposed to appear on Britain's TalkTV for an exclusive interview with host Piers Morgan Friday afternoon. Piers Morgan wrote on his official Twitter account that Daniels had to “suddenly postpone” the interview minutes before it was scheduled to begin due to “security issues.”\n\nFrom CNN’s Kristen Holmes\nFormer President Donald Trump’s team says they have raised over $5 million dollars since Trump was indicted Thursday.\nAxios first reported the new fundraising figures. \nCNN reported Friday that Trump had raised $4 million since news of the indictment.\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience."

                "content": "\n      A federal judge overseeing a civil battery and defamation trial involving Donald Trump has denied the former president’s motion for a mistrial.\n  \n\n      The ruling came before E. Jean Carroll, the columnist who sued Trump, again took the stand for cross-examination in a session that included questions about a “Law & Order SVU” episode and Trump’s former program “The Apprentice.”\n  \n\n      Trump had argued that Judge Lewis Kaplan had made “pervasive unfair and prejudicial rulings” against him. In a letter filed overnight Monday, his attorney Joe Tacopina said alternatively he would ask Kaplan to “correct the record for each and every instance in which the Court has mischaracterized the facts of this case to the jury” or provide him greater leeway in cross examining Carroll. \n  \n\n      “Here, despite the fact trial testimony has been underway for only two days, the proceedings are already replete with numerous examples of Defendant’s unfair treatment by the Court, most of which has been witnessed by the Jury,” the letter said.\n  \n\nE. Jean Carroll responds to Trump attorney: 'I'm telling you, he raped me whether I screamed or not'\n\n\n      Carroll sued Trump, alleging he raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s and then defamed her when he denied her claim, said she wasn’t his type and suggested she made up the story to boost sales of her book. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n  \n\n      Among the issues raised by Tacopina are the judge’s ruling restricting Tacopina from asking Carroll additional questions about any efforts Carroll made to try to obtain security camera footage from the department store, “expressing a corroborative view” that there was no one on the sixth floor of the department store at the time of the alleged assault, and calling certain lines of the defense attorney’s questioning “argumentative” in front of the jury.\n  \n\n      It would be unusual for the judge to declare a mistrial based on his own statements during a trial. \n  \n\n      During cross-examination on Monday, Tacopina sought to suggest that Carroll was not scarred by the alleged assault.\n  \n\n      Carroll testified that she continued to shop at Bergdorf Goodman, and Trump’s lawyer showed receipts indicating that Carroll spent more than $13,000 at the department store during 23 shopping trips between 2001 and 2018.\n  \n\n      “I made that clear that Bergdorf’s is not a place that I’m afraid to enter,” Carroll testified.\n  \n\n      She also agreed that she was a “fan” of the “The Apprentice” starring Trump and enjoyed watching the competition between aspiring businesspeople.\n  \n\n      Tacopina showed her a post on her Facebook page from August 6, 2012, in which Carroll wrote: “Would you have sex with Donald Trump for $17,000 (even if you could a) give the money to charity b) close your eyes? and he’s not allowed to speak?)” \n  \n\n      “You joked around about having sex with Donald Trump for money in this Facebook post, correct?” Tacopina asked Carroll.\n  \n\n      She responded that yes, she did.\n  \n\n      Trump’s attorney also reviewed a series of columns Carroll has written recommending that her readers report sexual abuse and other harassment to the police.\n  \n\n      Carroll acknowledged the advice she’d given readers to report allegations including rape to the police and explained why she didn’t call the police for herself.\n  \n\n      “I would never call the police for something I was ashamed of,” Carroll said. “I was ashamed of what happen. I thought it was my fault, I would never, never, never go to the police ever.”\n  \n\n      Tacopina also read excerpts from Carroll’s book and asked her why she didn’t sue former CBS executive Les Moonves after he denied her allegations that he sexually assaulted her in an elevator.\n  \n\n      “He didn’t call me names,” Carroll said. “He didn’t grind my face through the mud like Donald Trump did.”\n  \n\n      Also Monday, Tacopina asked Carroll whether she knew about a 2012 Law & Order SVU episode in which a woman is raped in a Bergdorf Goodman lingerie department dressing room.\n  \n\n      Carroll said she’s aware the episode exists and found the similarity to her own allegations astonishing, but never watched the episode. She testified she doesn’t watch Law & Order SVU because it’s too violent.\n  \n\n      The jury saw an email a stranger sent Carroll days after she first came forward in 2019 describing the episode to her. Carroll responded to the email at the time thanking the woman for her email but said she wasn’t aware of the episode.\n  \n\n      “Also there are 200 scripted shows a year on tv, this kind of thing is bound to show up. Indeed, I’m surprised this sort of plot is not seen more often,” Carroll also wrote in the email.  \n  \n\n      During redirect, Carroll’s attorney Michael Ferrara asked a series of questions about her knowledge of the episode.\n  \n\n      Has she ever seen the episode, Ferrara asked.\n  \n\n      “Never,” Carroll said.\n  \n\n      He also asked if she knows what happens in the episode or had seen it or heard of the episode before writing her book.\n  \n\n      Carroll again said no.\n  \n\n      Finally the lawyer asked, “Are you making up your accusation based upon what happened in a popular TV show?”\n  \n\n      Carroll, chuckling, again said no.\n  \n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2023 Cable News Network.

The Manhattan district attorney is attempting to spin a misdemeanor on which the statute of limitations has expired into a felony; Bragg wants to play alchemist but really he is just a progressive hack looking to make headlines.\nThat’s what he has: headlines, but headlines that are worth their weight in gold and may explain why Bragg has pursued a case that even many Democrats consider flawed and politically motivated.   \nFor several days, the media has fixated on the indictment of Donald Trump. The former president, as is his wont, has sucked the air not only out of the room, but out of the universe. Will he be cuffed? How does this impact the 2024 race? Can Trump still run? The breathless coverage has sidelined every other major news story.\nWhat a gift for Joe Biden. The president, who was supposed to announce his candidacy for a second term shortly after the New Year, and then immediately following the State of the Union address and then possibly… sometime in April. And now, maybe not until the fall, according to insiders.\nTRUMP'S ARRAIGNMENT: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWhy the holdup? Because Biden cannot possibly launch his re-election campaign while battling endless disasters and the scandals that are engulfing him, his family, and the White House. The initial plan to announce after the holidays was hijacked by the stunning revelation the first week of January that classified documents had been found among Biden’s papers at his Penn Center offices. And that the discovery, which occurred in early November, had been kept secret from the public until after the midterm elections. \nThe documents scandal is not going away. Just recently, Democrat Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, blasted Biden for withholding information about the secret materials found in his possession, saying the White House’s response \"does not pass the smell test\" and implying that Congress could issue subpoenas to get what they want. \nRevelations about Biden’s mishandling of classified materials and subsequent drop in his approval ratings forced him to retreat; it was especially embarrassing to the president since he had blasted Trump on his document problem.   \nDonald Trump is the first former president to be indicted on criminal charges. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images))\nBut that is only one of many hiccups in Biden’s campaign plans. Here’s a short list of what Trump’s indictment has helpfully bumped off Page One:\nThe jump in price will reignite voters’ fury over Biden’s ongoing efforts to squash U.S. oil and gas production, and will also extend rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Rising gasoline prices and a slowing economy will drive Biden’s approval ratings even lower. \nMeanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act, a green energy bill that passed with Democrat-only votes last year, was recently projected by Goldman Sachs to cost $1.2 trillion, more than three times the estimate given out by the White House or the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe bill was meant to spur traditional fossil fuel and clean energy investment, but West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin says the White House is \"subvert[ing] the law to advance a partisan agenda that ignores both energy and fiscal security\" by \"redefining \"domestic energy\" to increase \"clean-energy spending to potentially deficit-breaking levels.\" \nManchin says \"unelected ideologues\" are funneling billions into clogged clean energy arteries – the permitting process for wind and solar projects takes 10 years or more – instead of also ramping up oil and gas production, which would save Americans money. \nSo far, the Oversight Committee has revealed more than $1 million received from a CCP-linked company by Hunter Biden, James Biden, the president’s brother, and Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden who died in 2015. There are also payments to an as-yet unknown \"other\" Biden, who may prove to be the president himself; the president has denied any knowledge of his son’s business activities. Republicans involved in the inquiry say the money transfers suggest influence peddling, as no other services appear to have been rendered. \nThanks to Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, and his release of company communications, we now know that the Biden White House, the DNC, the FBI and others colluded to censor U.S. communications. \nIn early December, journalist Matt Taibbi began releasing tweets and internal emails that show Democrat-leaning groups used Twitter to suppress dissent and help elect Joe Biden. One typical exchange went as follows: \"One executive would write to another: \"More to review from the Biden team.\" The reply would come back: \"Handled.\" Of course, censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story became the most infamous example of social media’s willingness to interfere with our elections. But censoring nonconforming opinion about COVID might have cost lives. The House is also investigating social media censorship.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nA banking crisis resulted in one of the largest-ever failures of a U.S. bank – all because reckless Democrat spending ushered in dangerously high inflation, the Federal Reserve dragged its feet in responding for political reasons and then had to jack up interest rates at a dangerous pace. \nThe fallout, which regulators and supervisors should have anticipated, was a weakening of bank balance sheets, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and a bailout of Democrat-friendly tech firms. \nA Wall Street Journal reporter has been jailed in Russia and accused of spying, the first instance of an American journalist being detained for such allegations since the end of the Cold War. While other nations’ leaders have denounced the move, Joe Biden has been close to mum about holding Russia accountable.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThese are just a few of the stories that Trump’s indictment has bumped to the sidelines and that have prevented Biden from jumping into the 2024 race. \nThe president should be sending Bragg flowers or offering to make him the next attorney general.

After narrowly losing the Iowa caucuses to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Trump crushed his rivals a week later in the New Hampshire’s presidential primary, which rocketed the then-business mogul and reality TV star toward the nomination and accelerated the thinning of the GOP field of candidates.\nFour years later, the incumbent president demolished his long shot primary challenger — former Massachusetts Gov.

(Fox News)\nWhile the Trump campaign had already started staffing up in Iowa and South Carolina, Stepanek this past week made his first hire in New Hampshire, bringing on board Trevor Naglieri as state director. Naglieri, who has some experience working in the field in New Hampshire, is also a veteran of the campaigns of 2016 Trump rivals Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\nBut as of now, the Trump campaign’s operations for all of the early states will be steered out of  Iowa, and that’s not sitting so well with some Trump supporters in the Granite State.\n\"It rubs the activists the wrong way,\" a veteran of the Trump 2016 campaign in New Hampshire told Fox News. \nWHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE\nThe operative, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said that he and others \"feel like the successful team from 2016 has been largely abandoned.\"\n\"I think activists in the state that are sitting back, waiting to see how the field forms.

(Fox News )\nThere’s been a dearth of polling so far in the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire, but the latest two surveys — one public and one private — indicate Trump as the frontrunner. Surveys this early in an election cycle are far from a reliable prediction of primaries in 2024, though, and New Hampshire voters are known for making up their minds at the last minute.\nAsked whether New Hampshire is still Trump country, longtime Granite State-based Republican consultant Jim Merrill answered that \"it’s open to question. I’d say he starts with a head start, but other folks are on his heels here.\"\n\"I think he has to come back and has to earn it. It remains to be seen if he’s going to do that or not,\" added Merrill, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns.\nMatt Mowers, a veteran of the Trump 2016 campaign who later served in the State Department during the former president’s administration and who was the 2020 Republican nominee in New Hampshire’s First Congressional District, said that Trump has \"got a locked-in base of support, but it’s not a majority. And I think a majority right now are listening to all the candidates.\"\nMowers, who has ties to former ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — who declared her candidacy six weeks ago — as well as to Trump and to potential contenders former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is staying neutral as the field emerges.  \n\"Whether it's President Trump, who’s going to have to come back to New Hampshire and campaign the New Hampshire way — handshake to handshake — or others who are either running right now, like Ambassador Haley or people thinking about running, like Gov. Christie, they’re all going to have to do it the New Hampshire way,\" he said.\nVeteran New Hampshire conservative activist Greg Moore emphasized that \"New Hampshire is full of tire-kickers. We love to put candidates through their paces, and Donald Trump is no exception to that. He’s going to have to work just like any other candidate who wants to win New Hampshire. He’s certainly shown he can do that. He did that in 2016 pretty handily. And he has, without question, the best infrastructure of any candidate, so he’s well positioned.\"\nBut Moore, the longtime state director for influential conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, highlighted that Trump is \"still going to have to prove himself to New Hampshire voters, just like every other candidate.\nJuliana Bergeron, one of the two New Hampshire committee members on the Republican National Committee and a former Cheshire County GOP chair, doesn’t see her state as a lock for Trump. \"I do think there’s room for somebody like a [former Vice President] Mike Pence or Nikki Haley,\" she told Fox News.\nBergeron, who as an RNC committee member is staying neutral in the nomination race, said that he thinks Republican voters in New Hampshire are \"looking for a new generation of candidates.\"\nWhile Republican voters in New Hampshire will play a large role in determining the winner of their state’s GOP presidential primary, there’s another factor in play in the state.\nIndependents and undeclared voters in New Hampshire can vote in either major party’s primary. And if, as expected, President Biden seeks a second term in the White House, many independents who cast ballots in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential primaries in New Hampshire may vote instead in 2024 in what will likely be a much more competitive GOP primary.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The real issue is, will there be enough independents who take Republican ballots to change it,\" former state attorney general Tom Rath told Fox News. \nRath, a longtime GOP consultant and veteran of numerous Republican presidential campaigns, noted that \"independents will matter a lot in New Hampshire . . . they’re now in play in the Republican ballot, and that changes the primary electorate a great deal.\"\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\nSubscribed\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, discusses the indictment and prosecution of former President Trump and the Biden family's business dealings with China.\nJIM JORDAN TELLS MARIA BARTIROMO \"EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE\" AFTER THE INDICTMENT OF DONALD TRUMP\nMARIA BARTIROMO: Well, what are you. When are you expecting to speak with Alvin Bragg if he does not come to testify in front of the Judiciary Committee, will you subpoena him? \nREP JIM JORDAN: Everything's on the table, Maria. We're going to talk with the other chairmen and look at the response. We just got his letter back. We're reviewing that. But we think that this is here's I think maybe the most important thing. We think this is bigger. This involves all of us. I don't think it's an accident that the same week we learned that the IRS knocked on Matt Taibbi door while he's testifying in Congress. That same week is when we learned a district attorney has got a left wing district attorney, a Soros backed district attorney is going to go after the former president of the United States. \nREP JIM JORDAN: I mean, that is a scary thing that they paid a foreigner think about this. They paid a foreigner to put together a fake dossier to spy on President Trump's campaign. The FTC sends letters to Twitter demanding who are the journalists you're talking to? And then, of course, when Matt Taibbi is testifying, the IRS is knocking on his door and now an indictment of a former president, the guy who happens to be leading in every single poll. This is about all of us. This is about going after anyone who opposes the left's agenda, the establishment's agenda. And that's maybe the most scary thing of all. \nTRUMP ATTORNEY ALINA HABBA ON IF THE BARRAGE OF LAWSUITS WILL PREVENT DONALD TRUMP FROM RUNNING IN 2024\nMARIA BARTIROMO: Yeah. I'm making the point that there's a lot coming at President Trump even after this criminal case right now, Alina, these cases take time. I mean, this criminal case in the Manhattan DA's office is going to have a long proceedings. You're going to have discovery, you're going to have a motion process. And that is way beyond the four months which begin the GOP primary process, which, of course, the first debate is this August. Will this prevent President Trump from running in 2024?  \nA LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP'S ARRAIGNMENT SCHEDULE AHEAD OF TUESDAY COURT APPEARANCE\nALINA HABBA: No, I don't think so. I think this is going to strengthen him, in my opinion. If you look at the polls, if you look at the American people's opinion, he is leading in the polls and every time they come and hit him hard, Maria, every time they try and take him down, his base grows stronger. The American people are not dumb. They see what they are doing. I don't think so. I think he's going to get catapulted into that White House.  \nHOUSE ADMINISTRATION CHAIRMAN BRYAN STEIL ON ALVIN BRAGG’S USE OF FEDERAL DOLLARS IN THE INVESTIGATION OF DONALD TRUMP\nMARIA BARTIROMO: Wisconsin Republican Congressman Brian style. Brian, thanks very much for being here. You pushed back. I was one of the writers of that letter to Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg wanting information behind this suit. He wrote back saying you're actually breaching his sovereignty in New York. Where do we stand on that? \nTRUMP INDICTED AFTER MANHATTAN DA PROBE FOR HUSH MONEY PAYMENTS\nREP BRYAN STEIL: I think we asked him three important questions and we got a very telling answer on the first one. Are there federal dollars at play in this investigation? In his response, he admitted that, yes, there are federal dollars at play. I think we still need to know the answer to the second two questions. Is he in coordination with the United States Department of Justice? I think that's relevant because the United States Department of Justice looked at this case and chose not to move forward. And then third is usurping federal power over campaign finance law. Federal campaign finance law is the reason that we ultimately need to get answers to the question. The principle here, Maria, is that everyone is treated equally under the law. And it's all the more concerning when you look at this D.A. having a track record where as it relates to public safety on the streets of New York that I think most Americans disagree with. \nJOHN RATCLIFFE ON THE JUSTICE SYSTEM REPEATEDLY REQUIRING DONALD TRUMP TO ‘PROVE INNOCENCE’\nMARIA BARTIROMO: Nancy Pelosi tweeted that, that the president will have his chance to prove that he is innocent. See, she says no one is above the law. Everyone has the right to a trial to prove innocence. Actually, she got slam tradition because that's not the way our system works. Our system is, in fact, innocent until proven guilty. John. \nJOHN RATCLIFFE: Well, Maria, we saw this four years ago. Nancy Pelosi is not the first one to apply this standard to Donald Trump. The first one to do it was the Trump hating lawyers like Andrew Weissman and Trump hating federal agents like Peter Strzok that were part of the Mueller investigation, where Bob Mueller admitted four years ago that Donald Trump had to conclusively prove his innocence. He was the first person and only person in the history of the Department of Justice to have that standard applied to him. And now you see, Nancy Pelosi shows that for the four years that she was the speaker from 2018 to 2022, that's the standard she applied. She applied that to deprive Donald Trump of due process during two impeachments where he wasn't allowed to have legal counsel. The first president not to have that during the House proceedings. And we've seen it continue over into the Biden administration and the Department of Justice. Jim Jordan, you know, talking about the disparity in treatment, equal unequal treatment under the law between President Trump versus President Biden on the classified documents issue. So, you know, this issue, you know, has continued now for years. And what's happening in New York is only sort of the culmination of that of an assault that has been taking place for, you know, at least four or five years.\nMIRANDA DEVINE ON THE UNEQUAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRATS RUNNING INTERFERENCE \nMARIA BARTIROMO: Miranda doesn't feel like Democrats get in any trouble with election interference. We saw it with the Biden laptop before the election a few years ago where the FBI worked with Twitter to suppress truth.  \nTRUMP TARGETED: A LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE FORMER PRESIDENT; FROM RUSSIA TO MAR-A-LAGO\nMIRANDA DEVINE: Yes, this is their M.O. Whenever they're in trouble, whenever there is corruption or some other scandal to cover up, they will just blow smoke on the other side. And particularly when it comes to Donald Trump, I mean, election interference. What better election interference is there that we can see now than the leading candidate for the Republicans is being sort of legally persecuted with these weaponized fake prosecutions, starting off with Alvin Bragg in Manhattan. And, of course, the leaks. Who knows where they came from about this upcoming indictment of Donald Trump came two weeks ago, just 24 hours after those bank records were revealed by James Clymer. A bombshell story, if you ever saw one in the Hunter Biden laptop saga, and yet it was just buried and disappeared under the avalanche of Trump news.  \nPETER SCHWEIZER ON WHO IS PURCHASING HUNTER BIDEN’S ART \nMARIA BARTIROMO: Yeah. And I'm wondering if the influence peddling is happening as we speak in plain sight. I mean, look at Hunter Biden's artwork displayed among the best out there in New York this week. We don't know who's buying this art, Peter, because they've made a decision to say, oh, well, in the face of all of these questions, we're just not going to say who is the buyer of the art?  \nPETER SCHWEIZER: Oh, yeah, that's right. I mean, let's remember, in 2019, the Senate Banking Committee issued a report on how the art world was rife with money laundering and corruption. And so Hunter Biden has tapped into an industry where he can accept money in payment for, quote unquote, arts and whatever sum they want it to be. And there's no disclosure requirements. And here's the problem. Look, I mean, you can look at the Trump case and you contrast with a Hunter Biden case. Hunter Biden has already essentially admitted that he committed crimes. I mean, let's remember, in 2018, this grand jury was convened. They were looking into tax evasion charges, among other things, involving Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden gets a family friend to pay $2 million to the IRS, basically an admission that he didn't pay taxes he was supposed to. That's not a defense against tax evasion. And yet here we are three years later. The media is not interested in that story. They're not interested in the other things that the grand jury was looking at. So it's a stunning disconnect with the mainstream media.  \nTEXAS LT GOV DAN PATRICK TELLS MARIA THAT THERE COULD BE 14 MILLION GOTAWAYS AS THE END OF TITLE 42 NEARS\nMARIA BARTIROMO: How is it possible that Alejandro Mayorkas does not know what those wristbands are? I've seen those wristbands 100 times when I've been to the border several times, five times already. And secondly, what about title 42 going away? \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nLT GOV DAN PATRICK: So first of all, he's totally. Yeah. First of all, he's totally incompetent, Maria, to not know what those wristbands are. A Border Patrol agent, the first day on the job knows what those are. Secondly, remember, this is all part of the Biden plan. This is the leftist infiltration of America. By allowing us to be invaded not by an armed army, but an army of people that include terrorists and include criminals, sex offenders. And they know exactly what they're doing. And they played out this string, played out this game. Gee, I don't know. I don't want to call it a crisis because that would mean we have to leave our mission, as you just testified about recently. And when you say 7 million, I'm sorry. When you say about 7 million have been apprehended, remember in the last several years, that's the ones we catch, Maria. Our borders 1200 miles in Texas with Mexico. So if we catch one out of two, that's 14 million people. \nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox\nSubscribed\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

It felt like it is about who he’s running against again,\" Todd said. \"They even reference the first video. He really needs Donald Trump to be the nominee. And Donald Trump responded this Thursday by sort of focusing on him. Are they in a codependent relationship?\" \nNBC's Yamiche Alcindor responded that there were \"definitely benefits\" to having both Trump and Biden running against each other \"in both of their minds.\"\n\"The first few minutes of that video were January 6, abortion, and then you got into book banning having talked to voters. Democrats are very worried about their own freedoms. And really want to wrestle that word back from Republicans,\" she said. \nHUGE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS OPPOSE BIDEN RUNNING AGAIN, CITING ONE 'MAJOR' FACTOR: POLL\nChuck Todd asked his NBC \"Meet the Press\" panel on Sunday if Joe Biden and Donald Trump were in a \"co-dependent\" relationship.  (Screenshot/NBC/MeetThePress)\n\"So I think you see Joe Biden in that video making that case and making sure that people say, okay, you might have done something for the inflation or the bills, but your life is at stake. And I think there’s a little bit of a fear, frankly, that that’s being leaned into there, which we also saw on the Republican side,\" she continued. \nTodd added that it was \"fascinating\" that both candidates believe the \"other guy\" keeps them in the race. \n\"The poll that we just conducted this week shows pretty clearly that most Americans do not want to see either of these two guys at the top of the ticket right now, but we’re in a situation where there aren’t clear alternatives and if you go back to having this conversation of if it’s not President Biden who is it? And the same thing with President Trump, his stranglehold on the Republican base which I see every single day particularly in the House of Representatives is so strong, the idea that there would be some sort of Republican alternative in a serious way right now just doesn’t appear to be that clear,\" NBC's Ryan Nobles said. \nTodd asked former Democratic senator Claire McCaskill if there would be more \"Democratic hammering\" if Trump wasn't in the race. \nUS President Joe Biden speaks during an event at the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 77 training center in Accokeek, Maryland, US, on Wednesday, April 19, 2023.

Would Joe Biden run no matter what? Yes he would,\" she said. \"He has accomplishments, and I think he enjoys the job, and I think he would run no matter what. No question, but this is another thing, Chuck, that people forget. This is never a referendum. Presidential elections by the time they come around, well who do you like slightly better than the two you don’t like? It is a binary choice and even if its not Trump, extremism is on the ballot for the Republican Party this time whether they like it or not.\" \nBiden and Vice President Harris announced their re-election campaign on Tuesday in a video posted to social media. \n\"Every generation of Americans has faced a moment when they’ve had to defend democracy, stand up for our personal freedoms, and stand up for our right to vote and our civil rights. This is ours. Let’s finish the job,\" Biden said in the video.\nMANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE - APRIL 27: Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally on April 27, 2023 in Manchester, New Hampshire.  ((Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images))\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTrump criticized Biden's presidency shortly after his announcement and said he was \"the most corrupt president in American history.\" \n\"You could take the five worst presidents in American history, and put them together, and they would not have done the damage Joe Biden has done to our Nation in just a few short years.

And I know it's a hard case, and it's almost irrelevant because he's [Trump] not going to quit, and he doesn't have any requirement to quit. So, I expect him to continue. And ultimately, I think what we all want is for the voters to decide this issue, and not to have it decided in a courtroom. But I said that about – you know, he's under indictment. That is a reason for him to withdraw from it [the presidential race]. Because of how it undermines the strength of the presidency of the United States.

After nearly two years, Mueller's investigation yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination by the Trump campaign. \nTRUMP TARGETED: A LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING THE FORMER PRESIDENT, FROM RUSSIA TO MAR-A-LAGO\nTrump also referred to his impeachments. Trump was the first president in United States history to be impeached and acquitted twice.

Smith is investigating Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified records at Mar-a-Lago.\n\"Our justice system has become lawless,\" Trump said. \"They’re using it now, in addition to everything else, to win elections.\"\nTrump took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, who \"got rid of 33,000 emails.\"\n\"That was okay,\" Trump said.\nTrump slammed Smith as a \"lunatic special prosecutor.\" The former president also slammed President Biden, who is also under special counsel investigation for his alleged mishandling of classified records, and claimed that the documents he held at Mar-a-Lago were declassified.\n\"As president, I have the right to declassify documents. If I take them with me, it’s automatic declassify,\" Trump said, adding that Biden was vice president, and said he \"had absolutely no right to declassify.\" \n\"They like to say that I’m obstructing, which I’m not, because I was working with NARA very nicely until the raid on my home.\"\nSmith was appointed as special counsel after the FBI, in August, in an unprecedented move, raided Trump’s private residence at Mar-a-Lago in connection with an investigation into classified records the former president allegedly took with him from the White House on Aug. 8, 2022. \nCops line up outside of Manhattan court ahead of Trump arraignment.

James brought a lawsuit against Trump in September alleging he and his company misled banks and others about the value of his assets.\nTrump also slammed the Georgia grand jury investigating Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state, including his phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump suggested the Republicans \"find\" enough votes to change the results.\nTrump slammed the \"local racist Democrat district attorney in Atlanta who is doing everything in their power to indict me over an absolutely perfect phone call, even more perfect than the one I made with the president of Ukraine.\"\nTrump was referring to his first impeachment—brought after a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he suggested Ukraine should investigate the Biden family's business deals in Kyiv. \nDONALD TRUMP AND STORMY DANIELS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\"I kept saying that is a perfect call—this one was even more perfect,\" Trump said, referring to the Georgia call. \n\"This fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 election and it should be dropped and immediately,\" Trump said. \nTrump also slammed Hunter Biden and the Biden family, saying had their business dealings and the infamous Hunter Biden laptop been revealed before the 2020 election, the election results  \"would have been in our favor.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe charges against Trump come after a years-long investigation opened in 2019 by then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. The probe was focused on possible bank, insurance and tax fraud. The case initially involved financial dealings of Trump’s Manhattan properties, including his flagship Fifth Avenue building, Trump Tower, and the valuation of his 213-acre estate Seven Springs in Westchester.\nLast year, the investigation led to tax fraud charges against The Trump Organization and its finance chief Allen Weisselberg.\nBrooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

He then attempted to ask Jean-Pierre about her boss’ perspective on that. \"It’s not a 2024, not a Hatch Act-type question, let’s put it that way,\" Smith began, eliciting laughter from Jean-Pierre, who interjected, \"That’s what you think.\" \nHe continued, \"But Donald Trump is the front-runner at the moment – clear front-runner of the Republican Party. He wants to be president and he’s the front-runner of his party… This is somebody that President Biden has described as literally a danger to the country, and his movement an existential threat to democracy, etc.\"\nAfter the set-up, he finally asked, \"So candidate or not, is current President Biden, is he following the words and actions of Donald Trump on a fairly regularly basis, considering he’s a danger in his view?\"\nThe press secretary politely declined to answer, claiming that because the question pertained to a \"candidate in 2024,\" she’s \"just not going to speak to it.\"\nJean-Pierre added, \"What I can speak to is how the president is focusing on the American people and how he is delivering for the American people.\" She also mentioned that \"what we know to be a threat is the MAGA wing of the Republican Party and Speaker McCarthy,\" who she claimed are \"holding the American economy hostage.\"\nMCCONNELL RIPS BIDEN'S 'EXTREME POSITION' ON DEBT LIMIT IN FIRST SPEECH BACK AFTER CONCUSSION\nFormer President Donald Trump arrives at Trump Tower, Monday, April 3, 2023, in New York.

He asked pointedly, \"Why have you been willing to talk about President Trump before? And were you in violation of the Hatch Act when you did so?\"\n\"Absolutely not,\" she responded. She added, \"President Trump, we were talking about what he did in the last administration. We were talking about policies that were harmful in the past administration.\"\nThe press secretary then attempted to reiterate Smith’s question for Shear, saying, \"He asked me, does the president believe that Donald Trump is a threat if he wins, right? Because he’s a candidate?\"\n\"No, no, no, he didn’t ask that,\" Shear corrected her, laughing. Smith then chimed in, saying, \"Can I just say what I said?\" By that point other reporters in the room started chuckling at the cumbersome exchange as well.\nSmith continued, \"I was asking, is President Biden, does he follow the words and actions of this person, Donald Trump –\" \nJean-Pierre cut him off, saying, \"Yes! As a candidate! Right? As a candidate.\" She then held up her hand to quell Smith’s subsequent questions, saying, \"I’m not talking about 2024.\"\nAn exasperated Shear asked, \"2024?

Ron DeSantis stood at 21%, former Vice President Mike Pence at 6%, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley at 4%, Vivek Ramaswamy at 3%, and Sen. Tim Scott and former Rep. Liz Cheney at 2% each. Greg Abbott, Chris Christie, Larry Elder, Chris Sununu and Glenn Youngkin garner 1% apiece. Asa Hutchinson, Kristi Noem and Francis Suarez get less than 1%.\nTrump used his speech to lay out a number of his proposed policies, including restoring the economy; securing the border; holding China accountable for COVID; upholding the Second Amendment; \"restoring\" free speech; keeping \"men out of women's sports\"; and prohibiting \"child sexual mutilation in all 50 states,\" among other topics. \n\"This is what we must do to save our country from destruction,\" Trump said. \"2024 is the final battle.\"\nHe added: \"If we don't take over, we’re not going to have a country anymore.\"\nBrooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\nThe lawsuit alleges Cohen breached his attorney-client relationship by \"spreading falsehoods\" about Trump that were \"likely to be embarrassing or detrimental, and partook in other misconduct,\" while also breaching contractual terms of a confidentiality agreement he signed as a condition of employment with Trump.\nThe lawsuit alleges Cohen spread falsehoods about Trump \"with malicious intent and to wholly self-serving ends.\" \nThe lawsuit details Cohen’s \"myriad of public statements, including the publication of two books, a podcast series, and innumerable mainstream media appearances,\" while ignoring \"cease and desist\" orders.\nIt claims Cohen has, in recent months, \"increased the frequency and hostility of the illicit acts\" and \"appears to have become emboldened and repeatedly continues to make wrongful and false statements\" about Trump through various platforms.\n\"Such continuous and escalating improper conduct by [Cohen] has reached a proverbial crescendo and has left [Trump] with no alternative but to seek legal redress through this action,\" the lawsuit states, adding that Trump has \"suffered vast reputational harm as a direct result of [Cohen’s] breaches.\"\nMichael Cohen speaks to reporters after a second day of testimony before a grand jury in Manhattan. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\nThe lawsuit comes a week after the former president pleaded not guilty in Manhattan court to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York, related to alleged hush money payments made ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nA source close to Trump's legal team says the complaint against Cohen \"has nothing to do with the Manhattan DA’s lawless and fact-less case and is a totally separate matter.\"\nCohen, in 2018, pleaded guilty to arranging the hush money payments — among other federal charges — ahead of the 2016 presidential election to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, but maintains that Trump directed them.\nCohen also pleaded guilty to making false statements to a financial institution, making false statements to Congress and tax evasion. He was sentenced to three years in prison.\nFederal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York opted out of charging Trump related to the alleged hush money payments in 2019. The Federal Election Commission dropped its case on the issue in 2021. \nWhen asked for comment, Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, told Fox News Digital that \"Mr. Trump is once again using and abusing the judicial system as a form of harassment and intimidation against Michael Cohen.\" \n\"It appears he is terrified by his looming legal perils and is attempting to send a message to other potential witnesses who are cooperating with prosecutors against him,\" Davis said. \"Mr. Cohen will not be deterred and is confident that the suit will fail based on the facts and the law.\" \nDavis added: \"Is there anyone in America, aside from a shrinking minority base of believers, who takes Mr. Trump seriously when he files these lawsuits?\" \nTRUMP PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 34 FELONY COUNTS OF FALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS LINKED TO 2016 HUSH-MONEY PAYMENTS\nMeanwhile, Trump's lawsuit details Cohen’s employment as counsel for the Trump Organization, beginning in 2006, and past statements Cohen made about his role working for Trump.\n\"Among other innumerable positive statements made by [Cohen] about [Trump] and his role as [Trump’s] attorney, [Cohen] described his job as ‘very surreal,’ claiming he had 'been admiring Donald Trump since high school,'\" it asserts.\nThe lawsuit states that Cohen said Trump was a \"'wonderful man' who would be 'an amazing president,' and someone [Cohen] thought 'the world of' as a ‘businessman’ and 'a boss.'\"\n\"[Cohen] stated that [Trump] was ‘smart’ and ‘the greatest negotiator on the planet,’ and described his own role as the one ‘who protects the President and the family,’ and strongly stated that he ‘would take a bullet’ for Trump,\" the lawsuit states.\nMichael Cohen, former President Donald Trump's former lawyer, leaves his apartment to report to prison in Manhattan on May 6, 2019. (REUTERS/Jeenah Moon TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY/File Photo)\nThe lawsuit points to Cohen’s past statements that Trump \"deserved\" his \"loyalty\" because \"one man who wants to do so much good with so many detractors against him needs support,\" as well as Cohen’s comments calling Trump \"an honorable guy.\"\nThe lawsuit also alleges Cohen \"unlawfully converted [Trump's] business property when he fraudulently misrepresented a business expenditure and stated that he was owed an extra $74,000 over the true amount of the expenditure.\"\nFLASHBACK: LYNNE PATTON, TRUMP OFFICIAL AT COHEN HEARING, CLAIMED HE ONLY ‘TURNED’ WHEN MUELLER THREATENED WIFE\n\"[Cohen] was reimbursed based on the fraudulent misrepresentation, and accordingly converted $74,000 from [Trump,]\" the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit cites one of Cohen’s books, \"Disloyal,\" in which he \"by his own account\" admits he \"‘lied’ about the money he was owed in reimbursement for an expense he made on [Trump's] behalf, instead ‘loading up’ and ‘sneakily upping [his] bonus’ in order to ‘counter screw’ [Trump].\"\nCohen resigned as counsel for the Trump Organization in January 2017, when Trump was inaugurated, but continued to represent him personally until June 2018.\nThe lawsuit goes on to detail Cohen’s \"personal and professional downfall,\" citing the FBI’s raid of his home, office and hotel room in April 2018, after a warrant that reportedly included references to Cohen’s father-in-law’s loans to a taxi fleet operator in Chicago, worth tens of millions of dollars.\nCohen’s father-in-law was previously charged with \"conspiring to defraud the IRS and pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in connection with accounting practices related to his New York taxi business,\" the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit points to reports that indicated that \"prosecutors had evidence that also implicated [Cohen’s] wife in potential criminal activity,\" but that she \"was never charged.\"\nThe lawsuit points to the federal charges against Cohen, specifically the sentencing memo for U.S. v. Cohen in December 2018, which states that each of the counts he pleaded guilty to \"involved deception.\" The sentencing judge at the time said Cohen was found guilty of \"a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct.\"\nTRUMP-MANHATTAN DA CASE: BOB COSTELLO TESTIFIES TO GRAND JURY, SAYS MICHAEL COHEN IS A 'SERIAL LIAR'\nThe lawsuit points to statements made by federal prosecutors, who claimed Cohen’s crimes were \"motivated…by personal greed\" and effectuated by \"repeatedly using his power and influence for deceptive ends.\"\n\"[Cohen’s] improper, self-serving, and malicious statements about his former client, his family members, and his business constitute repeated and substantial violations of his continuing fiduciary obligations as an attorney,\" the lawsuit states, \"[Cohen] chose to capitalize on his confidential relationship with [Trump] to pursue financial gain and repair a reputation shattered by his repeated misrepresentations and deceptive acts, fueled by his animus toward [Trump] and his family members.\"\nThe lawsuit adds that Cohen \"must be held accountable.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nTrump is demanding that Cohen pay \"actual, compensatory, incidental, and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but expected to substantially exceed $500,000,000.\"\nBrooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Only Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., voted nay on the GOP side.\nSix burly energy workers with thick fingers, dressed in tan coveralls and hard hats, wedged their way in between the rank-and-file Republicans.\n\"Finally some real men in Washington,\" gushed Rep.

(Reuters/Tom Brenner)\nRepublicans deemed the energy measure \"H.R. 1.\" In congressional parlance, the lower a number for a House bill, the more important the majority party deems the legislation. Thus, H.R. 1 was at the top of the list for House Republicans.\n\"We made a commitment to America that we would lower your energy costs,\" said House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \"We made it H.R. 1 because we care… about the American family. Let them have more cash in their pocket to make their energy costs lower.\"\nRepublicans designed the House’s passage of the energy package to coincide with the start of the two-week Easter/Passover recess for Congress, the first lengthy break for lawmakers this year. Republicans wanted adoption of the drilling plan to serve as a punctuation point for this congressional work period for Republicans. \nThe GOP hoped that approval of the measure would give them something to tout to voters when they visited with constituents over the break. They also hoped the bill would show voters that Republicans were making good on their campaign promises.\nRepublicans also wanted to contrast their efforts to liberal Democrats who excoriated the bill.\nREPUBLICANS VOTE TO END BIDEN'S 'WAR ON ENERGY,' ONLY 4 DEMS AGREE\n\"H.R 1 is dead on arrival in the Senate, not because of politics, but because it's so ridiculous and has been drawn up by a bunch of pro oil senators,\" warned Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\nBut McCarthy insisted that Senate moderates who caucus with the Democrats – specifically Sens.

Republicans felt they were well-armed politically for the recess.\nThat assurance only lasted a few hours.\nBy 5:30 pm Thursday, all Republicans were talking about was former President Trump.\nWord leaked out that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg would hit Trump with a host of charges in the coming days. Most Republicans pivoted to rally around the former president and explain how the indictment was \"politically motivated.\" They declared it was inappropriate for a local prosecutor to target a former president, let alone a candidate for the 2024 presidential sweepstakes.\nTRUMP CRITICS SLAM DA BRAGG'S CASE AS 'WEAKEST OF SAUCES' AFTER FORMER PRESIDENT INDICTED\n\"They're trying to destroy Donald Trump because they fear him at the ballot box,\" proclaimed Sen.

Some top leaders issued statements. But Democrats generally gave Republicans a wide berth to defend the twice-impeached former president.\n\"This is not the time to wind up and say, ‘See! See! I told you so,’\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., on MSNBC.\nSo Democrats mostly stood back. They let Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., show up outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan to add to the sideshow. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., surfaced to spar with New Yorkers and the press corps over what she said was Trump's innocence.\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE LEADS NYC RALLY PROTESTING TRUMP INDICTMENT, AFTER RECEIVING WARNING FROM MAYOR ADAMS\nDemocrats ate it up. \nEnergy bill?

That may help boost the standing of some congressional Republicans with various quarters of the party and Trump loyalists. But one of the biggest takeaways from the 2022 midterms is that the former president damaged the party.\nThere were promises of winning 50 House seats. Seizing control of the Senate. Considering President Biden’s abysmal approval ratings, Republicans executed one of the poorest performances in decades for the party opposite the president in House contests. Senate candidates like Herschel Walker in Georgia, Don Bolduc in New Hampshire and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania prevented the GOP from flipping winnable Senate seats. Republicans concede privately that Trump has weighed down Republicans in three straight elections: 2018, 2020 and 2022.\nSo Republicans find themselves not discussing energy, inflation and gas prices, but former President Trump. He always commandeers the message.\nNew York District Attorney Alvin Bragg had been investigating former President Donald Trump for alleged hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.  (Shane Bevel/NCAA Photos via Getty Images | Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nWhat are Republicans now focusing on? Ways to investigate Bragg. A trio of House committees volleyed letters with Bragg asking about his historic inquiry of the former president. They’ve asked to see if there is coordination with the Department of Justice. They want Bragg to answer questions about his jurisdiction. Republicans have also threatened to dry up money from the DOJ for prosecutions. Comer hasn’t ruled out issuing a subpoena for Bragg.\nBragg’s office contends this is an \"incursion\" into their right to prosecute.\nThere’s also been criticism – even from Republicans – about the pace, scope and success of various inquests GOP-led House committees are conducting into the Biden administration and Biden family.\nEnergy policy? It seems to have been put aside.\n\"When that message is hijacked by, quite frankly, something that's really not very successful, it really ruins it for the rest of the Republican Party,\" said Alison Dagnes, a political science professor at Shippensburg University.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAs long as former President Trump is in politics, he will dominate all attention.\nAnd try as they might, Republicans can’t do much about it.\nEnergy bills aren’t the message; Trump himself is the message. \nChad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

Ron DeSantis of coordinating a \"shadow presidential campaign.\" \nMake America Great Again Inc., a pro-Trump PAC, had accused DeSantis of \"illegal conduct\" in a 15-page complaint filed in March. Taylor Budowich, a former Trump spokesman and now-head of MAGA Inc., had alleged that there was probable cause to investigate whether the governor had broken the law by fundraising through his Friends of Ron DeSantis PAC, having his team interview political operatives in early primary states, going on a \"personally lucrative book tour\" and taking other steps toward running for president while not officially declaring his candidacy for higher office.\nA spokeswoman for DeSantis, who is reportedly preparing to launch a campaign for president in mid-May, had called the complaint \"frivolous and politically motivated\" and said it was \"inappropriate to use state ethics complaints for partisan purposes.\" \nIn a 12-page report obtained by Fox News Digital, the Florida Commission on Ethics dismissed Budowich's filing \"for failure to constitute a legally sufficient complaint.\" \nPRO-TRUMP SUPER PAC DEMANDS DESANTIS ETHICS INVESTIGATION, GOVERNOR'S SPOKESWOMAN SLAMS ‘FRIVOLOUS’ ATTACK\nA pro-Trump super PAC filed an ethics complaint against Florid Gov. Ron DeSantis in March alleging that DeSantis had accepted illegal campaign contributions and is coordinating a \"shadow presidential campaign.\"  (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nThe commission found that Budowich and MAGA Inc. had repeatedly failed to make specific allegations against DeSantis that would constitute a violation of Florida law. \nFor example, Budowich alleged that DeSantis had \"solicited and accepted millions of dollars in benefits\" with an understanding that these donations would influence his decision to resign as governor of Florida to run for president. But the commission said that MAGA Inc. never alleged that there had been a specific \"quid pro quo\" that would violate the law. \n\"The compliant fails to indicate in a factual, substantive, nonconclusory manner that [DeSantis] solicited or accepted anything with an understanding that it would influence an official decision associated with his public office,\" the ethics board said. \"The complaint details alleged actions taken by other organizations for the benefit of [DeSantis'] anticipated presidential campaign, but never once expressly alleges that [DeSantis] and these organizations have an agreement or understanding, or that [DeSantis] has conditioned any public action on any donation, contribution, gift, or other thing of value.\" \nMAGA Inc. had also made several allegations that DeSantis had \"likely\" reaped illegal benefits from his book, \"The Courage to Be Free,\" including a $2 million advance, royalties from book sales and speaking engagements related to his book tour. \nFORMER ARKANSAS GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON LAUNCHES WHITE HOUSE BID, JOINING DONALD TRUMP IN GROWING GOP 2024 FIELD\nFormer President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. (Getty Images)\nIn regard to the book tour, the commission said that nothing alleged suggested that DeSantis' book advance had been \"unearned or is disproportionate to what other similarly-situated public figures could obtain for the same or similar work.\" \n\"With regard to the allegation that [DeSantis] has solicited or accepted gifts associate with the book tour, all of the details of this allegation are presented speculatively,\" the report states. \nThe commission also said that Budowich had failed to describe any \"affirmative act or omission\" by DeSantis that would constitute an abuse of his public position under the Florida Constitution and trigger an investigation. \nThe ethics board brushed off an allegation that DeSantis had misused his position \"with corrupt intent to benefit himself\" by making \"approximately 15 out-of-state campaign trips accompanied by his official security detail, at a reported cost of over $2.4 million to Florida taxpayers.\" \nTRUMP SIDESTEPS ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT SUPPORT FOR A NATIONWIDE ABORTION BAN\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks to Iowa voters on March 10, 2023, in Des Moines, Iowa. DeSantis is widely expected to declare his candidacy for president once the Florida legislature ends its current session.  (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\"The complaint does not indicate that the provision of a security detail to [DeSantis] when he is traveling is corrupt. There is a public purpose for the provision of protective services to the Governor and his family, even when he travels,\" the report states. \nFinally, the commission rejected allegations that DeSantis' contractural relationships for his book tour are \"conflicting\" because they cause him to be \"absent for Florida,\" citing a lack of \"adequate factual basis for this allegation.\" \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"There is no inherent reason why [DeSantis], as Governor, cannot travel outside the State, and the complaint does not provide additional information to establish that such travel creates a continuing or frequently recurring conflict between his private interests and the performance of his public duties,\" the commission said. \nThe ethics complaint was an escalation of Trump world's pre-emptive attacks against DeSantis, who polls consistently show is the runner-up to Trump in hypothetical 2024 primary contests, even though he is not a declared candidate. It was likely doomed from the start, as five of the nine members of the ethics commission were appointed by DeSantis. \n\"It is hardly surprising that another weaponized state entity controlled by DeSantis ignores the facts and the law to protect the Governor,\" Budowich told Fox News Digital. \"There is abundant evidence DeSantis is running an illegal shadow campaign for president and profiting from it at the expense of Florida taxpayers.\" \nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\nChris Pandolfo is a writer for Fox News Digital.

He garnered 54% of the vote in the latest Fox poll, which was completed before a Manhattan grand jury issued a sealed indictment ahead of today’s arraignment.\nBut Trump’s GOP rivals are not acting like Jones; they are rallying behind him.\nThink about the strangeness of the situation.

They don’t want to whack Trump over the indictment because they don’t want to alienate his voters. They’ve all concluded that they can’t win the nomination, let alone a general election, if MAGA supporters think they’ve engaged in unnecessary roughness toward their man.

Perhaps another indictment, related to vote-tampering or classified documents or Jan. 6, would change that equation, or perhaps not.\nEven likely candidate Chris Christie, whose whole rationale is that he’s willing to go toe to toe with his former ally, told me: \"I don’t know what Bragg is thinking, to bring a seven-year-old hush money case in a borough that’s overrun with crime.\"\nTrump’s dominance of the news right now – yes, even as a defendant – may be his biggest advantage.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n    \nFox News host Tucker Carlson shreds Alvin Bragg for his approach to the justice system and indictment of Trump on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'\nHere's a story from over the weekend. At about 5 a.m. on Saturday morning in Manhattan, a parking garage attendant called Moussa Diarra noticed a man peering into parked cars looking for things to steal. Now, that's a familiar scene in New York City. Alvin Bragg, who is the local Soros-funded D.A., has decided that prosecuting car burglaries is a form of white supremacy. As a result, not surprisingly, car burglaries have risen quite a bit. \nMoussa Diarra, the attendant is not White, but apparently, he's sick of watching other people get robbed. So, he told the man to get out, leave the garage. In response, the man pulled out a handgun and fired four times. He hit him in the head and the stomach. It was a nightmare. But somehow, Moussa Diarra had the presence of mind to wrestle the gun from the man and then fire back before the man could shoot him or anyone else. By the time police arrived, both men were lying on the sidewalk, bleeding. \nNow, what do you think happened next? In a scene, self-respecting society Moussa Diarra would have received a medal if not a ticker tape parade, but in the city of New York, he was arrested and charged with attempted murder and illegal possession of a gun – the same gun that had been used to shoot him. Diarra woke up in Bellevue Hospital shackled to his bed. The New York Post ran this picture of him sobbing. \"I got bullets in me and I'm chained to a hospital bed,\" he said. \"But I didn't do anything wrong.\" \nYou can imagine his confusion. This was not the country he expected and in fact, Moussa Diarra is exactly the kind of person you want more of in your country. He's 57 years old, and he's still working harder than most young people do. In fact, when New York shut down during COVID, as lawyers and nonprofit executives hid in their apartments living on DoorDash and stockpiling surgical masks from Amazon, Diarra went to work every day like Americans used to.  \nWAPO FACT-CHECKER IS FACT-CHECKED HIMSELF BY TWITTER'S COMMUNITY NOTES ON ALVIN BRAGG AND GEORGE SOROS \nThe man who shot him, by contrast, does not have a history of going to work every day. His name is Charles Rhodie. We checked. He's got a rap sheet of nearly a dozen serious crimes that go back more than 20 years and yet, as of Saturday at 5 a.m., he was not in jail. He was walking around New York with a gun looking for more things to steal. \nIn the end, Alvin Bragg caved to public outrage, which was considerable, and dropped the charges against Moussa Diarra, but he had already made the point very clear to everyone. In our new Soros-inspired justice system, decent people are the criminals, while the criminals are now a protected class.  \nHere's how it works. The people in charge unleash chaos in our cities, but if you dare to protect yourself or your family from that chaos, you wind up in handcuffs. What is this? Well, the name of this system of governance is anarcho-tyranny. You get state sponsored anarchy accompanied by political tyranny. \nSince taking office, Bragg has done his best to increase the anarchy. He's increased the number of felony charges his office drops by nearly 40%. That includes almost half of all drunk driving charges. It's no longer really a crime to drive drunk in New York City. That's the anarchy part. But for those who step outside the political lines, it is tyranny.  \nYou'll remember the middle-aged bodega clerk called Jose Alba from the Dominican Republic. Bragg sent him to Rikers Island, one of the worst prisons in the world, for daring to defend himself against a lunatic who was trying to murder him. So now this very same system, the system that imprisoned Jose Alba and chained Moussa Diarra to his hospital bed, the Soros-inspired and backed system, is putting Joe Biden's main political opponent in the upcoming presidential race on trial for a crime that's not actually a crime. This is the political tyranny part of an act of anarcho-tyranny.  \nSo, for our existing legal system, this appears to be a point of no return, and you would think the media would point that out. Even if they support it, this is a big change from the way the country has run for hundreds of years. But no, because they're too dumb, too shallow and above all, too self-interested. \nSo, Trump's upcoming arraignment tomorrow isn't a turning point in our country's legal system. It's yet another chance to follow Trump around in the hope that ratings will return. This was CNN all day today: \nCNN: We are being told right now that is Donald Trump leaving Mar-a-Lago on his way to catch his plane that will leave to New York where he'll arrive later this afternoon. We're watching really history right now unfold on your screen, Donald Trump in route to the airport and a court date in New York becoming the first ever former president to face a criminal indictment. \nAFTER TRUMP INDICTMENT, MANHATTAN DA ACCUSES HOUSE GOP OF 'UNLAWFUL POLITICAL INTERFERENCE' \nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in at the Waco Regional Airport in March 2023. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\nCNN: This is a historic moment. We just watched the former president of the United States or a former president of the United States leave his home, headed to New York to be arraigned in court.  \nCNN: We're watching on our screen as Trump's motorcade has now arrived on the tarmac at Palm Beach International Airport.  \nCNN: Heading up in the air and heading back to his home state of New York, certainly not the kind of homecoming that he had ever imagined when he went back from Florida to New York, but he is heading back on a historic flight again, not necessarily a part of history that Donald Trump or any former president would want to make. \nCNN: One of the things that we have learned is to not put everything at an 11, not make everything the biggest deal. This is a big deal. \nYou know, this is a big deal. We get to talk over live pictures, what we were trying to do in local news. Well, it is a big deal, actually. It's a very, very big deal, but the guardrails are gone. No one in the media seems to be pointing out that this is a huge change in our entire legal system and no one in the Democratic Party in Washington, even those who are a little bit concerned about where this might be heading, dare say anything at all, because Alvin Bragg is, of course, a holy person and no one wants to speak out against the crowd on Twitter.  \nWHO IS ALVIN BRAGG? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MANHATTAN DA. \nSo, this is all happening in slow motion and of course, we're getting the dumbest possible lectures, as always, from cable news. \"We've learned not to put everything at 11. We're not making everything the biggest deal.\" It's hilarious\nAnd of course, they can't wait to make it the biggest deal on the shallowest possible level and the reason this economic. Since Trump left office, CNN has lost more than 60% of its viewers. They're desperately trying to sell the channel because, like, it's tanking. They have every incentive to sensationalize anything that Trump does, no matter what happens to the country in the process. \nSo, here we have a Soros-funded DA perp-walking a former president. What does this mean? What could Trump possibly be guilty of? They don't even tell you. All they tell their eager but small audience is the walls are closing in on criminal Donald Trump. They're going to turn Trump's motorcade into O.J'.s Bronco, because otherwise you're going to be out of a job because nobody watches them anymore.  \nThat's a sober assessment of what's happening in this country from saying look at the plane, look at the motorcade. Before long, outlets like CNN may be your only source of information about the trial. and that's the scary thing. Imagine a system where the person who's been charged is no longer allowed to defend himself. \nOh, are you seeing the connection here? Like the parking garage attendant who was shot by a criminal, he gets arrested. Like Jose Alba, who tried to save his own life from a lunatic in his bodega, he gets arrested. The people who are the victims of the tyranny don't get to speak. CNN speaks for them. Imagine that. \n'TRUMP FORCE ONE' LANDS IN NEW YORK AHEAD OF FORMER PRESIDENT'S DAY IN COURT \nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 06: Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg arrives to the courtroom during the Trump Organization tax fraud trial at the New York Supreme Court on December 06, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) ((Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images))\nThere are multiple reports tonight that Alvin Bragg's office will seek a gag order when Trump is arraigned. That would prevent Trump on pain of going to prison from talking about his case in public, but CNN and MSNBC and The New York Times and The Washington Post, all the completely filthy, corrupt liars in the media handmaidens to power, they'll be able to say whatever they want because apparently their coverage doesn't influence the jury – only the accused defending himself. Well, it's only unconstitutional, baldly, so. It's also completely immoral and above all, in the middle of a presidential race, it's a subversion of democracy itself.  \nThe leading candidate from the other party doesn't get to talk or you send him to prison? Wake up. First, where is Michael Beschloss on this? Where are the august historians are always telling us about, you know, the architecture of our democracy, our democratic norms. Is that a democratic norm, silencing the other party's main presidential candidate on pain of going to jail? They like the power, and they're going to continue to exercise it until somebody stops them. \nToday, the mayor of New York City, a great disappointment, we thought he would be a good mayor, hasn't been a good mayor. It's sad. So, to divert attention from his own ineptitude and the hours he spends in bars at night, he's now decided to become a political celebrity. He is now threatening to jail a member of Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene, if she dares to protest Donald Trump's arraignment in a way that he doesn't like. Watch this. \nALVIN BRAGG'S SOFT-ON-CRIME POLICIES SCORCHED AFTER TRUMP CHARGES: THINGS HAVE GOTTEN 'PROGRESSIVELY WORSE' \nMAYOR ERIC ADAMS: While there may be some rabble rousers thinking about coming to our city tomorrow, a message is clear and simple. Control yourselves. New York City is our home, not a playground for your misplaced anger. People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech stated she's coming to town. While you are in town, be on your best behavior. As always, we will not allow violence or vandalism of any kind and if one is caught participating in any act of violence, they will be arrested and held accountable.  \n\"New York City is our home. That's why we let people c--- on the sidewalk and hookers turn tricks in the vestibule of ATM machines.\" Really? It's your home. Your home is filthy, and you are incompetent. \nPeople like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is known to spread hate speech. Really? What's hate speech? Well, it's speech that certain politicians hate. That's all it is. There's no hate speech prescribed in the Constitution. That's completely made up. It's a power grab. Of course, politicians didn't use to dare to talk like this because someone would call them and say, \"Whoa, whoa, slow down. We have a Bill of Rights,\" but those people are hiding and like Michael Beschloss.  \nThey are too afraid to say what's obviously true, which is we're watching the system itself collapse. So, you get to this jail a former president on some fake crime for a payment he made seven years ago. That was completely legal. Once you get to do that, we just can go after all your political enemies with the force of law. And that's what they're doing, because no one's stopping them. \nToday, Fox News learned that Merrick Garland DOJ is sending subpoenas to Trump Secret Service agents as part of their probe into his handling of classified documents. Now, if there was ever a fake crime, it's this.  \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \nEveryone who ever served in federal office, from Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden to Mike Pence, has admitted to bringing home documents in violation of the law. We have a billion classified federal documents, probably 2% of which deserve to be classified. The whole system is rotten and corrupt and everybody knows it, but they're using it in order to stop someone from running for president. Is that OK with the defenders of democracy? Then there's the grand jury for woman in Georgia going on MSNBC saying, we're investigating Trump for saying the wrong things about the 2020 election.  \nSo, they want to take out Trump, but in a democratic system, you do that by convincing people to vote against him. In a tyrannical system, you use people with guns to stop him from running and that's honestly exactly what we're seeing. Even if you don't like Trump and have no intention of voting for him in this next cycle, you should have the right to vote for him because that's democracy. And anyone who takes that right away from you is a tyrant and is presiding over a system that is not democratic but totalitarian, obviously.  \nGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.\nSubscribed\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

Pence had initially rebuffed the subpoena as unconstitutional, arguing that the Constitution's speech and debate clause prevented him from discussing aspects of Jan. 6, 2021.\nPence now has assurances that he will be shielded from such questions, and his office says he will no longer contest the subpoena himself.\n\"Having vindicated that principle of the Constitution, Vice President Pence will not appeal the Judge’s ruling and will comply with the subpoena as required by law,\" spokesman Devin O'Malley said in a Wednesday statement.\nPENCE RIPS 'TWO-TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM' AS HE FIGHTS BIDEN DOJ SUBPOENA\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence will no longer contest a subpoena to testify regarding Jan. 6 after receiving certain assurances.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n    \nFox News contributor Jonathan Turley says one of Trump’s lawyers was forced to leave his law firm for representing the former president on ‘America Reports.’\nOscar Wilde once said \"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself.\" \nWith the release of the indictment of former President Donald Trump, Manhattan District Alvin Bragg has revealed himself as a follower of the Wilde school of legal thought. Bragg knew that he had no criminal case against Trump. However, after running on bagging Trump for some crime (any crime), Bragg knew that many would not care if he had a basis for a criminal charge. He would be lionized to be the first person to ever indict a former president in the blind rage against Trump.\nAfter charging Trump with 34 counts, Bragg insisted that he will convict Trump of the \"crime to promote a [political] candidacy through unlawful means.\" He insists that he will prove \"attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\"\nFor months, many have raised objections to the effort of Manhattan District Attorney to use a flawed legal theory to essentially litigate a federal election violation that the Justice Department opted not to charge. This bootstrap theory has been widely criticized, but many in the media sought to cut off that debate by suggesting that Bragg might be basing his prosecution on some unknown crime. Last week, Michael Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis went as far to \"warn all the pundits and everyone speculating...that there are lots of facts, lots of documents, lots of evidence of multiple crimes.\"\nREAD THE INDICTMENT: TRUMP CHARGED WITH 34 FELONY COUNTS OF FALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS\nWe now have the indictment, and it is basically what many of us anticipated. It is a series of stacked counts of falsifying business records for the purpose of influencing the election. The indictment seems to address the lack of legal precedent with a lack of specificity on the underlying \"secondary\" felony. Bragg has done nothing more than replicate the same flawed theory dozens of times. This is where math and the law meet. If you multiply any number by zero, it is still zero.\nIf the New York bench retains any integrity, this case will be thrown out as legally improper with an admonition to Bragg and his office for politicizing the criminal justice process. That, however, may be asking a lot of state judges who are elected on both the trial and appellate levels. They, too, may prove to be lawyers on the Wilde side.\nThe cost, however, to the legal system will be immense. In a single indictment, Alvin Bragg bulldozed any high ground that the Democrats had after January 6th. He has fulfilled the narrative of Trump by supplying a raw and undeniable example of the politicization of the legal system. What is most shocking is that this attack on the rule of law was met with the rapturous applause of many, including lawyers and legal pundits. They not only will ignore the affront to the integrity of our legal system, but celebrate its demise.\nIf the New York bench retains any integrity, this case will be thrown out as legally improper with an admonition to Bragg and his office for politicizing the criminal justice process. \nBragg himself threw a flag on the effort to indict Trump being pushed by a lawyer brought in as a special assistant district attorney for that purpose. Mark F. Pomerantz and his colleague Carey R. Dunne resigned -- and their resignation letter was then leaked to an eager media. Pomerantz then took a step that floored many of us: he wrote a tell-all book based on the still ongoing investigation. \nHowever, Pomerantz admits that career prosecutors balked at his radical proposals to find a crime -- any crime -- to nail Trump. That included an entirely bonkers money laundering charge against Trump where he would be the victim of an extortion effort. \nIn his book, Pomerantz admits that \"many of the lawyers were relentlessly negative.\" Some prosecutors were clearly so upset by his efforts that they \"defected\" from the team. He also admitted that Bragg told him \"that the consensus among the group of prosecutors with whom he had been speaking was not to go forward.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nDespite objections from his colleagues who said he was undermining their efforts, Pomerantz published a book making the case against an individual who was not charged, let alone convicted. It was a grossly unprofessional and improper act. It also worked. Bragg caved to the overwhelming pressure that followed. If figures like Pomerantz were going to yield to temptation, why shouldn't he?  After all, no one wants to be the last ethical lawyer when even one else is cashing in.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg speaks on Donald Trump arraignment April 4, 2023. (Fox News)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nI remain hopeful that there remains a modicum of judicial integrity in New York to stand against this effort. However, this is a defining moment for many who have rationalized this abuse of the criminal justice system. For those attorneys, they have reached the point described by Robert Oppenheimer after the development of the atomic bomb. He stated \"In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humour, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe same is true for many in our profession. While some of us have warned that Mar-a-Lago could present a serious threat to Trump, we have warned that the Bragg prosecution is the denial of the core legal principle of blind justice. This expensive, drawn out effort would not have occurred for anyone other than Donald Trump. It is not just selective prosecution, it is exclusive prosecution for Trump and Trump alone.\nFor those lawyers applauding this ignoble moment, this is our sin as a profession, and it is \"knowledge which they cannot lose\" in the years to come.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEY\nGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.\nSubscribed\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

However, the document repeatedly criticizes the Trump administration for constraining the conditions of American evacuation, during which 13 American soldiers died in a suicide bombing while protecting the Kabul airport. \nThe review does acknowledge that the evacuation of Americans and allies from Afghanistan should have started sooner, but blames the delays on the Afghan government and military, and on U.S. military and intelligence community assessments.\n\"President Biden’s choices for how to execute a withdrawal from Afghanistan were severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor,\" the document states. \nUN OFFICIALS CONDEMN TALIBAN'S DECISION TO BAN AFGHAN FEMALE STAFFERS FROM WORKING AT THE UNITED NATIONS\nPresident Biden, first lady Jill Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken look on as a carry team moves a transfer case with the remains of Marine Corps Cpl.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\nThe White House accuses Trump of emboldening the Taliban by engaging in peace talks without consulting U.S. allies and partners in the region. The document emphasizes that at the same time, Trump was decreasing the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan with a series of drawdowns throughout 2020. \n\"During the transition from the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration, the outgoing Administration provided no plans for how to conduct the final withdrawal or to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies,\" the White House says. \"Indeed, there were no such plans in place when President Biden came into office, even with the agreed upon full withdrawal just over three months away.\" \nThe U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan precipitated the disastrous collapse of the Afghan National Security Forces and the Taliban's takeover of Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021. Biden oversaw evacuation efforts for U.S. allies, translators and Afghan refugees considered at risk of retribution from the radical Islamist forces overtaking the country. Nearly 1,000 American citizens were left behind and later evacuated. Thousands of Afghan allies remain in the country. \nPresident Biden delivers remarks on the terror attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul Afghanistan, and the U.S. service members and Afghan victims killed and wounded in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 26, 2021. (POOL via CNP/INSTARimages/Cover Images)\nThe document released by the White House gives a broad overview of the administration's actions and recounts the details of the Afghanistan withdrawal from their perspective.\n\"As you all know, over these many months, departments and agencies key to the withdrawal conducted thorough internal after-action reviews, each of them examining their decision-making processes, as well as how those decisions were executed,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. \n\"Today, they are making those reviews available to relevant committees in the Senate and in the House, as previewed by Secretaries [Antony] Blinken and [Lloyd] Austin in testimony last month,\" he added.\nBIDEN ADMIN ACCUSED OF ‘STONEWALLING’ GOP ON KEY AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL CABLE: ‘IT RAISES MY SUSPICION’\nBy the time Biden assumed office, the White House says, \"the Taliban were in the strongest military position that they had been in since 2001, controlling or contesting nearly half of the country.\"\n\"While it was always the president's intent to end that war, it is also undeniable that decisions made and the lack of planning done by the previous administration significantly limited options available to him,\" Kirby told reporters at Thursday's White House press briefing. \n\"President Biden inherited a force presence in Afghanistan of some 2,500 troops. That was the lowest since 2001. He inherited a special immigrant visa program that had been starved of resources. And he inherited a deal struck between the previous administration and the Taliban that called for the complete removal of all U.S. troops by May of 2021, or else the Taliban, which had stopped its attacks while the deal was in place, would go back to war against the United States.\"\nHundreds of people gather near a U.S. Air Force C-17 transport plane at a perimeter at the international airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 17, 2021. (AP)\nKirby said the Trump administration failed to provide any plans to remove U.S. troops, to transition security to the Afghan government or to increase processing for special immigrant visas for Afghan allies. \nENEMIES NO LONGER FEAR US RESPONSE AFTER BIDEN BOTCHED AFGHANISTAN, EXPERTS SAY AMID BALLOON, DRONE CLASHES\n\"Transitions matter. That's the first lesson learned here. And the incoming administration wasn't much of one,\" he said. \"Thus, President Biden's choice was stark: either withdrawal of our forces or resume fighting with the Taliban. He chose the former.\" \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nChris Pandolfo is a writer for Fox News Digital.

DeSantis would be \"rolled\" by Donald Trump and said he should \"pack up and wait a few years.\"\nOn the surface, former President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom would seem to be political foes, but they appear to share the same goal: taking down Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nIn recent weeks, both Trump and Newsom have launched relentless attacks against DeSantis, using similar arguments and talking points not only to target the Florida governor's record but also seemingly to push him out of the 2024 presidential race before he ever enters it.\nMeanwhile, Trump and Newsom have refrained from targeting each other harshly, even when given the opportunity to do so, creating a curious political situation in which the nation's most prominent Republican and one of its most prominent Democrats are seemingly allied in directing their political ire toward DeSantis.\nNewsom, a Democrat, has been regularly attacking DeSantis for the several months, calling the Florida Republican a \"bully,\" airing a TV ad slamming his governorship, and even challenging him to a debate.\nFormer President Donald Trump, center, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, right, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, left (Getty Images)\nGAVIN NEWSOM'S OFFICE FAILS TO PROVIDE PROOF OF FLORIDA COLLEGE BOOK BAN CLAIMED BY CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR\nTrump, however, only starting attacking DeSantis over the last couple of months as he wages his 2024 Republican presidential campaign. DeSantis, who hasn't announced a White House bid, is nonetheless widely considered Trump's chief rival in the GOP primary.\n\"Ron DeSantis is a young man who is not doing well against me in the polls, to put it mildly,\" Trump wrote this week on Truth Social. \"I believe that if he decides to run for president, which will only hurt and somewhat divide the Republican Party, he will lose the cherished and massive MAGA vote, and never be able to successfully run for office again.\"\nIn a press release sent out hours later, Trump's campaign questioned whether DeSantis would support a change to Florida law that requires state lawmakers to resign if they're running for federal office. The campaign also referenced how, in 2018, DeSantis resigned from Congress while running for governor, suggesting it would be hypocritical to campaign for president now while continuing to serve as governor.\n\"Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to campaign full-time for president, during the Florida legislative session, while collecting a salary and having the taxpayers pick up the costs for his travel and security. It's a massive flip-flop from his position in 2018,\" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"To make matters worse, DeSantis' upcoming taxpayer-funded campaign travel appears to put him at odds with Florida's existing 'Resign to Run' law.\"\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, left, and former President Donald Trump (Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images // Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nGov. Gavin Newsom offers DeSantis political advice, says he will get 'rolled by Trump': 'Pack up and wait'\nLast month, Trump also lambasted DeSantis as an \"average\" and \"big lockdown\" governor. Trump noted that as president he gave governors the \"freedom\" to respond to COVID as they saw fit, and he argued that other Republican governors handled the pandemic more effectively than DeSantis did.\nRepublicans and conservatives have generally praised Florida for reopening earlier than most states amid the COVID lockdowns of 2020. Still, the former president argued that Florida under DeSantis fared worse than New York with a high COVID death rate and has performed poorly in crime and education rankings. \nNewsom has followed suit in recent weeks, using strikingly similar attack lines as Trump against DeSantis.\nFlorida \"had fifty-eight percent higher per capita death rates under COVID. That's freedom? Fifty-eight percent higher per capita death rates?\" Newsom said in a podcast interview. \"Their education system? [California] outperformed during COVID. . . . There's a lot of myth out there, a lot of BS.\"\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, left, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (Getty)\nDeSantis targets Trump's past praise of Fauci as issue to exploit in potential 2024 match up\nNewsom more broadly slammed DeSantis' broader leadership in an MSNBC interview that aired Sunday, and argued he'd be defeated easily in the 2024 presidential race.\n\"He's going to get rolled by Trump. Trump is just going to roll him. Thumped,\" Newsom said of DeSantis. \"I, honestly, if I were offering political advice, I would tell him to pack it up and wait a few years and actually do some of the hard work, which actually includes governing, not just identity and culture war.\"\nNewsom has also been frequently criticizing DeSantis on social media, targeting the Florida governor over a host of issues from abortion to free speech.\nMeanwhile, Newsom has refrained from attacking Trump, even when given the opportunity. During the same MSNBC interview that aired Sunday, for example, Newsom was asked whether he would be able to continue working with Trump as president if he were to beat Joe Biden in a re-election contest. Newsom responded that Biden would win, but he nonetheless entertained the notion of a Trump victory. Instead of attacking Trump, California's governor referenced his ability to work with people with whom he disagrees.\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nTRUMP TAKES HEAT FROM RIGHT FOR SAYING HE DIDN'T 'HIT' NEWSOM BECAUSE CALIF GOV SAID NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM\n\"I don't like talking past people or down to people because they disagree with me. I've spent a disproportionate amount of time with the people who tried to recall me,\" said Newsom. \"We all want to be respected, protected, connected. We all want to love. We all need to be loved. We have so many foundational values. . . . There's some universal things about being human that I also think are important, so I say this in the context of the frame around Trump or all these folks.\"\nTwo days later, Trump told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview that he hadn't \"hit\" Newsom because the California governor had had nice things to say about him. \n\"He was always very nice to me, said the greatest things,\" Trump said of Newsom. \"He would say things like, 'He's doing a great job.'\"\n\"About you?\" asked Carlson.\n\"About me, that's why I could never hit him, because he was so nice to me, just laying in wait right?\" Trump said. \"But he was very nice to me, relatively speaking.\"\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Hilton Anatole on August 6, 2022, in Dallas, Texas.

However, Trump supporters were quick to note that the former president also criticized Newsom in his response before focusing on the governor's positive comments.\n\"You have a very ambitious guy in California, but he’s done a terrible job with the state,\" said Trump. \"I used to get along great with him when I was president. Got along really good . . . Gavin.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhen reached for comment, Trump's campaign pointed to specific examples of the former president \"eviscerating\" Newsom. One was a YouTube video of Trump slamming Newsom's immigration policies at a rally in Tennessee, suggesting to the crowd that the governor wants the country to look like Venezuela. The campaign also sent screenshots of multiple social media posts of Trump blasting Newsom for doing a \"terrible\" job on forest management and addressing California's homeless population.\nFox News Digital has also reached out to Newsom and DeSantis for comment but did not receive immediate responses.\nAaron Kliegman is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital. \nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\nSubscribed\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

McDougal told Anderson Cooper that Trump offered her money, which she declined, said they had real feelings for each other, and that the Enquirer didn’t provide her with the promised opportunities.  \nBut the heart of the case is what has been widely reported: Trump accused of falsifying business records, related to his reimbursement of former fixer Michael Cohen, who passed the $130,000 to Daniels, the porn star. Such charges are misdemeanors, but Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg bumped them up to felonies by tying them to a federal election law violation at the end of the 2016 campaign and also saying Cohen’s reimbursement was doubled so that he could declare the income to the IRS and not be shortchanged. The Trump team says the transactions were unrelated to the campaign and that he was trying to protect his family from embarrassment.TRUMP FACES STAGGERING MAXIMUM SENTENCE IF CONVICTED ON 34 FELONY COUNTS\nThose on the right are going to seize on the lack of new accusations as evidence that Bragg, an elected Democrat, has brought a politically motivated prosecution. Those on the left will emphasize the gravity, not to mention the sordid nature, of the felony charges, and keep repeating the number 34, though that’s simply the number of invoices allegedly falsified.\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in at the Waco Regional Airport in March 2023. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\nProsecutors recounted one unconfirmed if salacious incident: that National Enquirer’s parent company paid $30,000 to a doorman who said he knew that Trump had a child out of wedlock. That was later determined to be untrue.\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche told reporters there were no surprises in the indictment and that \"he’s frustrated, he’s upset.\"TONGUE-TIED TRUMP RIVALS CAN’T TRASH THEIR INDICTED TORMENTOR\nBragg told reporters that Trump’s \"intent\" was \"to conceal another crime...to hide damaging information from the voting public.\" Asked why he brought the charges now, Bragg said he filed the case \"when it was ready.\"\nTrump, at Mar-a-Lago last night, said \"this fake case was brought only to interfere with the upcoming 2024 elections.\" He said \"radical left\" prosecutor Bragg campaigned on getting him \"at any cost\" and that the D.A. was the \"criminal\" for illegal leaking and should resign. He also slammed Judge Juan Marchan as a \"Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife.\"\nTrump recycled many of his greatest hits, invoking Hunter Biden’s laptop, \"which exposes the Biden family as criminals,\" he said without evidence. The former president also attempted to discredit the other pending investigations, calling special counsel Jack Smith a \"radical left lunatic\" and \"bomb thrower,\" and Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis \"a local racist D.A.\" He took no questions. \nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (L) leaves his office in New York on March 30, 2023. - Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg became the first prosecutor in US history to charge a former or sitting president when he filed his indictment against Donald Trump.

There was a discussion of Trump’s heated rhetoric on Truth Social, including highly personal attacks on Bragg and Judge Marchan. But the judge did not issue a gag order. \nFormer US President Donald Trump speaks at the East Palestine Fire Department in East Palestine, Ohio, on February 22, 2023 (REBECCA DROKE/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 4, which means the trial itself could get under way just as Republicans are starting to vote in the primaries and caucuses.\nWe caught just brief glimpses of Trump as he walked in and out of the courthouse, in part because his entrance was obscured by the semi-permanent New York scaffolding.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n    \nBryan Llenas reports on former President Trump's frustrations after pleading not guilty to 34 felony charges.\nFormer President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign has been invigorated by the indictment by New York’s Manhattan DA on flimsy charges of falsifying business records seven years ago. The former president has growing momentum, added fund-raising and better poll numbers in the Republican primary.\nMaybe this is exactly what Democrats want. After all, President Joe Biden seems dead set on running for re-election even though no president with a job rating as low as Biden’s has ever gotten re-elected. His best chance, many strategists believe, is to run a re-match against Trump. But our recent polling shows that Biden loses to Trump in a rematch given the state of the economy, immigration, and crime.\nLast December, Trump had a 2024 campaign announcement that lacked energy, was barely noticed, and he was giving rallies that few news outlets were even covering. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was every month gaining new voters in the Republican primary while Trump was stalled. Then the full force of the law started coming after Trump and resuscitated his campaign and his political life. \nThe indictment is splitting Americans along party lines. Eighty percent of Democrats supported an indictment, 79 percent of Republicans opposed it, and Independents were split 51-49 against according to the March Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll. Most Americans, however, also believe that the indictment is politically motivated and the Trump will eventually be acquitted.\nJONATHAN TURLEY: DONALD TRUMP INDICTMENT IGNORES THIS CORE LEGAL PRINCIPLE\nA review of the actual indictment raises even more questions about how it could possibly be issued. It claims that payments made in 2017 affected the 2016 election and fails to specify any crime that was committed to trigger making it a felony and extending the statute of limitations. Even in NY, this indictment is, in my view, likely to be tossed, further energizing the Trump campaign.  \nAmericans are split along party lines over how the indictment will affect Trump’s presidential chances. Sixty-seven percent of Democrats think it will hurt his candidacy and 57 percent of Republicans say it will help, according to the March Harvard CAPS/Harris poll. The actual effect may depend on how skillfully Trump responds. His speech to his supporters was calmly delivered but was also more of a laundry list of personal grievances than a stirring call to electoral action. A majority of Americans in each party disapproved of his calls for protests in the run-up to the indictment, and he could lose more moderates if he veers anywhere near January 6-style behavior. \nThe indictment presents difficult problems for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the clear front-running challenger to Trump. Recently DeSantis has doubled down on cultural conservatism to go after the Trump base but with little success. He would be better off focusing on character and competence rather than the culture wars to bolster his campaign. He won an overwhelming re-election in Florida because he handled COVID and a recent hurricane well, not because he took on Disney. He needs to reset his campaign and differentiate from Trump, not try to mimic him.\nTrump will still be a formidable primary frontrunner regardless. Half of Republican voters would pick Trump in an open GOP primary and 56 percent would pick him in a head-to-head primary against DeSantis. But DeSantis has the favorability and growing image to mount a real challenge. DeSantis leads all figures in the Harris Poll with 47 percent favorability and has the largest favorable/unfavorable gap of +14 points. Trump has a similar favorability at 46 percent, but his favorable-unfavorable gap is 1 point underwater with 47% against him. Compared to 94 percent of voters who are familiar with Trump and Biden, only 81% have even heard of the Florida governor, giving him some potential for growth. Tim Scott is also well liked among those who know him, but has a long way to go to establish a national identity. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\nFormer US President Donald Trump departs after delivering remarks at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, US, on Tuesday, April 4, 2023.

DeSantis has a high 76% favorable with Republicans and is polling better in early primary states; an early win in a place like New Hampshire would flip the whole dynamic of the race. \nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOver on the Democrat side it seems as if the Democrat establishment is coalescing around Biden rather than go through a bruising primary. The close midterm contest has provided a rationale for continuing to back Biden, and the party has, unlike the Republicans, shown a strong measure of cohesion. The more they bank on Biden, the more they are counting on a Trump rematch they mistakenly believe they can win. By kicking his announcement to late summer, Biden has frozen the field in his favor and staved off lame-duck status. \nThe Trump bump is real, and the country is edging closer to a Trump/Biden rematch in 2024. Both these candidates have such baggage with swing voters however, that the party bases may be missing how much better either party would do if they nominated a fresh face with the experience to serve as president. \nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARK PENN\nMark J.

(Shane Bevel/NCAA Photos via Getty Images | Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\nThe indictment uses a novel legal theory and relies heavily on the testimony of the president’s former fixer Michael Cohen, a disbarred attorney and convicted liar.\nTrump is accused of falsifying internal business records when he had Cohen arrange a $130,000 hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter. He has denied the affair.\nCohen, then an employee of the Trump Organization, used a shell corporation to pay off Daniels one month before the election. \nAfter Trump’s victory, Cohen was reimbursed $420,000 disguised as payments for legal services rendered pursuant to a phony retainer agreement. The figure included the tax he’d have to pay on the income and a $60,000 bonus.\nTRUMP SUES FORMER ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN FOR $500 MILLION\nBragg alleged that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen orchestrated the hush money payments on behalf of Trump. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\nBragg has argued that this payment was an illegal campaign contribution because it wasn’t disclosed and exceeded the amount allowed under federal law. \nCohen was convicted in 2018 of federal charges, including campaign-finance violations, for arranging hush-money payments to Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claims she had an affair with Trump, which he has denied. \nA few months later, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress.\nAfter serving a stint in prison, Cohen grabbed a pen and wrote a book blasting Trump as \"a cheat, a mobster, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man\" and has continued to attack the former president in countless media interviews.\n\"If Michael Cohen told you today was Wednesday would you believe that unless you looked at your own calendar?\" former Manhattan prosecutor turned criminal defense lawyer Mark Bederow told Fox News Digital. \nSTORMY DANIELS ON WATCHING TRUMP INDICTMENT: ‘THE KING HAS BEEN DETHRONED’\nBederow added that prosecutors would likely also have to call Daniels to the stand, who could be perceived by some as an unsympathetic opportunist.\nShe has repeatedly made contradictory statements to the press and has shown an insatiable appetite for media attention, the attorney said.\nTo bump up the misdemeanor charge of falsifying business records to a felony, the indictment alleges that Trump intended to commit or conceal a second crime.  \nThe indictment doesn’t state what this second crime is, and Bragg said at a press conference he isn’t legally required to disclose it.\nTRUMP LEGAL BATTLES CONTINUE, EVEN AFTER MANHATTAN DA CHARGES\nBut Bragg, when asked by a reporter, implied that Trump violated state and federal campaign finance and tax laws. \n\"The bottom line is that it’s murky,\" said Richard Hasen, an expert in election law and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles law school. \"And the district attorney did not offer a detailed legal analysis as to how they can do this.\"\nHe added that it is not clear whether a case can be brought in state court if it involves a federal election law.\nMANHATTAN DA ALVIN BRAGG SUES REP. JIM JORDAN OVER TRUMP INDICTMENT SUBPOENAS\nAt the press conference, Bragg suggested that Trump may have also violated a New York election law that makes it illegal to conspire to promote a candidate by unlawful means, and that he lied to state tax authorities when he mischaracterized the reimbursements to Cohen as income.\n\"If you bring an unprecedented case like this against a former president and current presidential candidate, it’s essential for the credibility of the criminal justice system to present a clear and cogent explanation of your theory as opposed to saying 'I don’t have to tell you,'\" Bederow said. \n\"If you come at the king, you best not miss,\" he said, quoting the HBO hit \"The Wire.\" \nHad Bragg charged Trump with 34 misdemeanor counts of falsifying business records, it would have been a breeze, said Bederow.\n\"It appears overwhelming that the way this was structured in terms of payments to Cohen as legal fees is false,\" he said.\nBut the misdemeanor charges weren’t an option because the \"two-year statute of limitations has 100%, no doubt, expired,\" Bederow added, referring to the window of time prosecutors have to initiate a criminal case. \nFormer President Donald Trump departs Trump Tower on Thursday. Trump was scheduled to appear before New York State Attorney General Letitia James for a deposition that morning. (Felipe Ramales for Fox News Digital)\nThe time restraint on the felony charge is five years and appears to have passed, but this calculation isn’t straightforward. \nNew York law has a provision called tolling, which stops the clock whenever a defendant leaves the state. If Trump was in Washington, D.C., or Florida, those periods of time aren’t counted. COVID-19 also paused the statute of limitations for a significant period of time.\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWhile Bragg’s case may have some challenges, he does enjoy a vital edge, Bederow said.\n\"This is Manhattan, so the DA has an overwhelming home-court advantage,\" the attorney told Fox News Digital of the solidly blue borough. \"If you put Donald Trump on trial for the Kennedy assassination, a Manhattan jury would probably find he's the guy in the grassy knoll.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nRebecca Rosenberg is a veteran journalist and book author with a focus on crime and criminal justice.

He asked Trump to avoid language that could \"jeopardize the rule of law.\"\nWhile the admonition applied to both sides, it was prosecutors who jumped in to say they were worried about Trump’s inflammatory style, citing his link to photos showing him holding a baseball bat next to a shot of Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg’s head. Trump’s attorneys said that as a candidate, he had the right to defend himself and counter illegal leaks.\nOnce Trump flew back to Florida from New York, the question hung in the air: Would he follow the judge’s advice?\nAS EXPECTED, TRUMP INDICTMENT ALL ABOUT FALSIFYING RECORDS – FOR HUSH MONEY\nJudge Juan Merchan, far right, addresses former President Donald Trump, far left, regarding his rights and requirements, Tuesday, April 4, 2023, in a Manhattan courtroom in New York.

He is under indictment. The judge will have plenty to say about how the trial plays out.\nBut when Trump spoke in prime time to an enthusiastic crowd at Mar-a-Lago, it seemed that toning it down was not in his DNA.\nHe called Bragg a \"radical left\" prosecutor, adding: \"The criminal is the district attorney because he illegally leaked massive amounts\" of grand jury material, and should resign.\nTONGUE-TIED TRUMP RIVALS CAN’T TRASH THEIR INDICTED TORMENTOR\nHe called Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith a \"bomb thrower who is harassing hundreds of my people day after day over the boxes hoax.\" That refers to the probe of Trump mishandling classified documents, in which Smith is reported to be pursuing possible obstruction of justice charges.\nHe called Fani Willis, the Georgia prosecutor looking into vote-tampering, \"a local racist Democrat district attorney\" who is doing everything in her power \"to indict me.\"\nAnd then he went after Judge Merchan himself: \"I have a Trump-hating judge with a Trump-hating wife and family whose daughter worked for Kamala Harris.\" \nSo much for restraint.\nFormer US President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at the South Carolina State House in Columbia, South Carolina, US, on Saturday, Jan. 28, 2023.

He’s convinced that is how he won the White House the first time around, by punching and counterpunching.\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\nThe defendant blames Merchan for the imprisonment of his friend Allen Weisselberg, overlooking the fact that the former Trump Organization CFO chose to plead guilty.\nThere is a pattern here. In 2016, Trump attacked Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was hearing a fraud lawsuit involving Trump University, by saying his Mexican background presented an \"inherent conflict of interest\" based on the candidate’s plan to build a border wall. He also called Curiel, who was born in Indiana, a \"hater.\" \nDuring the Mar-a-Lago speech, which MSNBC refused to carry on the grounds that Trump was lying, he didn’t repeat some previously scathing language–such as calling Bragg a \"degenerate psychopath.\" But he came out swinging.\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at his Mar-a-Lago estate Tuesday, April 4, 2023, in Palm Beach, Fla., after being arraigned earlier in the day in New York City.  (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump said: \"REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS SHOULD DEFUND THE DOJ AND FBI UNTIL THEY COME TO THEIR SENSES. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TOTALLY WEAPONIZED LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR COUNTRY.\"\nDefund the police? For my adult lifetime, the Republicans ran as the party of law and order and called the Democrats soft on crime. Now that seems flipped on its head. Trump and many Republicans are constantly on the attack against federal law enforcement, while the Democrats argue no one is above the law.\nThe Bragg indictment is a flimsy document that has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum. Of course Trump is entitled to attack the case and the man who brought it, but as both candidate and criminal defendant, he may learn that his life has changed.\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel's MediaBuzz (Sundays 11 a.m.-12 p.m. ET). Based in Washington, D.C., he joined the network in July 2013 and regularly appears on Special Report with Bret Baier and other programs.\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

Four anonymous Biden aides, who were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations with the outlet, pointed to Trump's surge in the polls following his indictment by a grand jury. The former president faces unprecedented criminal charges stemming from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's investigation into payments he made to Stormy Daniels in 2016.\nTrump has used the indictment to galvanize his base, claiming political persecution at Bragg's hands. The vast majority of elected Republicans, even declared and expected candidates in the 2024 GOP primary, have issued statements condemning Bragg's actions. \nIn such an environment, those close to Biden have good reasons to believe that the president will face Trump again in a rematch, should he follow through with plans to run for reelection.
